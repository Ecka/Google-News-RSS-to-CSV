cnn,Republicans reject calls to probe Trump role in hush-money payments,"(CNN) President Donald Trump may have committed crimes over a scheme to pay off women alleging extramarital affairs -- but Senate Republicans say they have no reason to look into it.

GOP leaders and key committee chairmen are making clear that they believe there is no reason to probe whether the President broke the law in engaging in a scheme to hide payments made to two women to keep their stories quiet in the days running up to the 2016 elections.

Sen. Ron Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and investigated Hillary Clinton's email controversy in the last Congress, says he wants to wait until special counsel Robert Mueller finishes his investigation first.

Told that the investigation into the hush-money scheme was being led by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Johnson said: ""We'll let the justice system work its way. ... I want to see the definitive information as opposed to show-trial type testimony at congressional hearings.""

Trump met Tuesday with Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, to discuss border security and immigration ahead of a Wednesday Senate hearing. But Trump also discussed ""harassment stuff"" with the lawmakers, Graham told CNN.

""He just believes they are out to take a wrecking ball to his life,"" Graham said of Dems. ""They'll go nuts.""

Graham said he told Trump to ""listen to his lawyers"" about whether to comply with the Democratic requests. ""You just have to put your head down, fight back and govern the country — that's what (Bill) Clinton did,"" Graham said, adding that Trump should challenge Democrats to ""fix problems.""

Graham said concerns about the Democratic probes comprised about ""10%"" of the meeting. Asked whether Trump suggested he should fight back, Graham said there was little that he could do, but he planned to use the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate ""abuse"" under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which would continue the GOP-led House probes in the last Congress into accusations of FBI and Justice Department misconduct.

The decision to ignore allegations that Trump may have broken the law -- and wrote a check reimbursing his former personal attorney Michael Cohen for the payments while serving as President -- highlights the stark contrast between the priorities of the Democratic-run House and Republican-run Senate over the next two years. Democrats say the GOP is ignoring its constitutional duties to oversee the Executive Branch -- and with several powerful committees ramping up oversight over all aspects of the President's political life, business career, campaign, transition and inauguration.

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff announced Tuesday several new committee hires, including Daniel Goldman as a senior adviser and director of investigations. The hiring is notable because Goldman worked from 2010-2017 for the Southern District of New York — which charged Cohen over the hush-money payments — where Goldman was deputy chief of the organized crime unit.

Republicans say Democrats are overreaching and setting the stage for impeachment.

""I think what the Democrats are worried about now is the hysteria over the alleged collusion, that they're worried the Mueller report will come up with basically nothing against the President,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and adviser to the GOP leadership. ""That's why I think their full-frontal assault, which as I said I think is a prelude to impeachment and will make sure that we can't get anything else done.""

Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said the hush-money payments that Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen said the President repaid while in office wouldn't be on his ""top five"" list of issues to investigate, because the Mueller and the federal prosecutors in New York are already probing it.

""I think there are some House members that decided they want to start the election early, and they're going to do everything they can to tear down the President,"" Kennedy said. ""I'm not saying that the Republicans wouldn't do it if the shoe were on the other foot — that's part of the problem with this place.""

In a statement Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders blasted the new House investigation as ""a disgraceful and abusive investigation into tired, false allegations already investigated by the Special Counsel and committees in both Chambers of Congress.""

Trump weighed in on the Democratic probes later Tuesday, telling reporters, ""The witch hunt continues,"" and adding that ""basically"" Democrats have ""started the campaign.""

Trump also appeared to suggest that his predecessor hadn't complied with congressional investigations into the Obama administration.

""President Obama, from what they tell me, was under a similar kind of a thing. They didn't give one letter. They didn't do anything. They didn't give one letter of the requests. Many requests were made. They didn't give a letter.""

House Democrats are rapidly ramping up their investigations into all elements of Trump's world, from his businesses to his administration. After Cohen's blockbuster testimony last week — where he displayed a check Trump paid him in 2017 as partial reimbursement for the October 2016 payment to Stormy Daniels — three House committee said they wanted documents and testimony from Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg.

Weisselberg was one of 81 people and entities that received letters from House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Monday asking for documents on a wide-range of issues, marking the start of a sprawling investigation into possible corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.

One Senate committee continues to probe possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016: The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is two years into its investigation into Russia's 2016 election meddling. The panel also interviewed Cohen last week behind closed doors, the day before his high-profile public testimony, but lawmakers say the President's role in hush-money payments is beyond the scope of the committee's probe.

In 2017, the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee did launch an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr. was promised ""dirt"" on Clinton's campaign from a Russian lawyer. That probe wrapped up last year amid infighting between Democrats and Republicans over witnesses, with Democrats demanding Trump Jr. and others return for public testimony.

""The Senate Judiciary Committee has a responsibility to be more aggressive in continuing its investigation which unfortunately we short-circuited,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the panel. ""We need to bring back Donald Trump Jr. and anyone else who has known about those hush money payments.""

Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior member of Senate Judiciary who chaired the panel in the last Congress, wouldn't say if he had concerns about Trump's involvement in a hush-money scheme.

""You always ask me questions that I haven't studied,"" Grassley said Tuesday. ""So I can't say.""

A fellow Iowa Republican on the Judiciary panel, Sen. Joni Ernst, also suggested she wasn't fully aware of the hush money when asked if the committee should look into the scandal.

""Possibly at some point -- I don't know enough about it,"" Ernst said.

On the House side, Republicans can do little while in the minority to stop their Democratic counterparts. Instead, they've vocally criticized their Democratic colleagues for trying to tear down the President with their investigations. Trump has also frequently slammed them on Twitter as ""presidential harassment.""

After attacking Cohen's credibility at his hearing last week, Republicans downplayed the significance of the hush-money allegations.

""I think it's news we knew about,"" Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight panel, said after the hearing concluded.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Nadler, whose committee would lead impeachment proceedings, of deciding to impeach Trump ""the day the President won the election.""

Asked if he was concerned about the President directing the hush-money payments, McCarthy instead put the blame on Cohen.

""You know what concerns me? If you hire an attorney -- if I hire an attorney to make sure I carry out the law, the attorney has a responsibility to tell me what's right and wrong in the process,"" he told ABC News. ""If it's a finance campaign, those are fines. Those aren't impeachable in the process.""

Some of the President's allies are also not eager to engage in the controversy.

Asked Tuesday if he had any concerns about Trump paying off women and allegedly breaking the law, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas ignored the question and kept walking.

politico,Democrats’ demand for Trump’s tax returns expected in about 2 weeks,"Trump’s personal returns will likely be easier to digest than his business ones, which could be exceedingly complicated. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Congress Democrats’ demand for Trump’s tax returns expected in about 2 weeks

House Democrats plan to formally demand President Donald Trump’s tax returns in about two weeks, a key lawmaker said Tuesday.

They intend to seek a decade’s worth of his personal tax returns, though not his business filings, said Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Story Continued Below

“We’re almost ready to go,” said Pascrell, who’s led a push among lawmakers to use an arcane law to unmask Trump’s tax returns.

A 1924 law allows the heads of Congress’s tax committees to examine anyone’s confidential tax filings. Lawmakers can also vote to make those returns publicly available, experts say.

“The chairman will be ready in two weeks to send his letter,” Pascrell said. “And I volunteered to deliver it.”

A spokesman for Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) did not respond to requests for comment.

COUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

The effort appears to have ramped up in the wake of testimony last week by Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen, as well as by the possibility that special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-anticipated report might soon be released.

Cohen told lawmakers last week that Trump has refused to release his returns because he fears public scrutiny will subject him to ""taxable consequences."" Trump himself also once expressed surprise at receiving a $10 million tax refund from the IRS, Cohen testified.

""He said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving 'someone like him' that much money back,"" said Cohen.

Trump’s personal returns will likely be easier to digest than his business ones, which could be exceedingly complicated. The business filings would reveal more about his finances though, and some lawmakers are still pushing Neal to seek those as well.

“Because of the intermingling of Trump’s personal business with the public business, it makes it all the more important to get his business returns,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), another top tax writer.

“Don’t limit this to individual returns — they will not provide the answers to most of the questions we have,” he said.

A Treasury Department spokesperson said that Secretary Steven Mnuchin will review the legality of any request for Trump’s returns with Treasury attorneys.

Trump has defied a decades-old tradition of presidents voluntarily releasing their returns, and lawmakers hope his filings will answer a long list of questions about his finances. Among them: potential conflicts of interest; how he benefited from the recent tax overhaul; if he’s been under audit as he has long claimed; and how well the IRS has vetted his taxes.

“The tax returns are the key to finding out what this guy is all about,” said Pascrell.

Trump’s returns are unlikely to be released anytime soon, even once Democrats make their request. The administration is promising a fight in court, and Trump has an incentive to stall, perhaps in hopes of winning back the House in 2020.

The timing of making their demand has been tricky for Neal.

He’s been pushing a go-slow approach, saying Democrats needed to build a careful legal case. Neal also knows that going to war with the administration over the returns risks any chance of finding agreement on all sorts of unrelated legislation, no small consideration when he has only been head of the panel for a few months.

At the same time, though, he’s taken flak from liberals for not acting quickly enough.

Democrats’ bid comes with its own controversy because it would go well beyond the few instances in which the law has been used over the past half century.

Critics say the effort will open the door to lawmakers weaponizing returns by releasing private information about their political opponents. The same rationale Democrats are using to seek Trump’s returns could be used to release others’ tax documents as well, they warn.

March 5, 2019, 5:33 PM GMT By Courtney Kube

WASHINGTON — Two months after declaring all U.S. troops are leaving Syria, President Donald Trump wrote to members of Congress that he now agrees ""100%"" with keeping a military presence in Syria.

A bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives wrote to Trump on Feb. 22, applauding his decision to keep a small residual force in Syria.

""We support a small American stabilizing force in Syria,"" the group wrote, adding that a force ""which includes a small contingent of American troops and ground forces from our European allies, is essential to ensure stability and prevent the return of ISIS.""

In a copy of the letter obtained by NBC News, Trump highlighted a paragraph in the letter about the U.S. goals in Syria, which said, ""Like you, we seek to ensure that all of the gains made in Syria are not lost, that ISIS never returns, that Iran is not emboldened, and that we consolidate our gains and ensure the best outcome in Geneva for American interests.""

""I agree 100%. ALL is being done,"" President Trump responded, writing directly on the letter and signing it.

Since before he took office, Trump has promised to end the fight against the Islamic State, criticizing the cost to the U.S. in both blood and treasure. In a video message on Twitter posted Dec. 19, 2018, the president said: ""Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won.""

The Syrian Democratic Forces continue to battle ISIS in the small area of land they still control in the Middle Euphrates River Valley in Syria. U.S. military officials say the battle to re-take the final part of the town of Baghuz still held by ISIS has been slowed by the exodus of thousands of civilians and the terror group's use of some women and children as human shields.

Late last month, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed that some U.S. troops will stay in Syria after the Syrian Democratic Forces finish clearing out Baghuz.

""A small peace keeping group of about 200 will remain in Syria for period of time,"" Sanders said in a one-sentence statement. U.S. military officials have since confirmed the residual force could be double that and that some U.S. troops could stay in the northeastern part of the country, and others in southern Syria.",0,0,0,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-he-agrees-100-percent-keeping-u-s-troops-n979466
cnn,Trump says he joked about wanting Russian help in 2016. The facts tell a different story.,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump recently claimed he was joking when he asked the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 campaign. But court filings and public comments show some members of Trump's team were quite serious about accepting help from the Russians in 2016.

In the heat of the presidential campaign in July 2016, Trump publicly encouraged Russia to hack Clinton's private server and release her emails. His comments, at a news conference in Miami, have come back to haunt him as he fights the Russian collusion investigation.

He revisited that controversial call Saturday during his wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, suggesting it was all a joke to rouse an audience.

""If you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena,"" Trump said, before re-enacting his 2016 comments. ""If you say something like, 'Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please. Please get us the emails. Please!' ""

Trump has a habit of passing off problematic remarks as jokes. It happened after he said Democrats were ""treasonous"" for not applauding his 2018 State of the Union address. He did it again after encouraging police officers to be ""rough"" with suspects, and after challenging then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to an IQ test.

Over the past two-plus years, we've learned there were multiple serious efforts by Trump's inner circle to seek political help from the Kremlin or Russian affiliates during the election. The question remains whether Trump knew about or directed any of those efforts.

For starters, look at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Six days before the meeting, Rob Goldstone, a well-connected associate of Trump's, emailed Donald Trump Jr. to say that the Kremlin was actively trying to help his father and was eager to provide the campaign ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary.""

Trump Jr.'s now-infamous response was, ""if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer."" He quickly set up the meeting and looped in his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. (They all insist nothing came from the rendezvous.)

There's also Roger Stone, the longtime Trump ally and self-avowed ""dirty trickster.""

Stone wasn't officially working for Trump's campaign in 2016, but he stayed in regular contact with the candidate and maintained a loose network of associates tied to WikiLeaks. In 2016, the website published emails that Russian government hackers had stolen from Democrats.

In January, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Stone for lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks. Prosecutors said a senior Trump campaign official had been directed to ask Stone about future WikiLeaks releases after the July 2016 dump of Democratic National Committee emails.

Prosecutors also described how Stone tried to create a back channel with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and funneled helpful tidbits back to Trump's orbit. Stone pleaded not guilty.

During that 2016 news conference, Trump questioned whether Russia was behind the hacks and mocked the possibility that he had had anything to do with the WikiLeaks releases, saying, ""It is so farfetched. It's so ridiculous. Honestly, I wish I had that power. I'd love to have that power.""

Trump may say he was only joking that day, but Mueller noted a striking coincidence of events when he indicted a cadre of Russian hackers.

Following Trump's comments, Russian hackers working ""after hours"" tried ""for the first time"" to hack email accounts used by Clinton's ""personal office"" and the campaign addresses of dozens of Clinton staffers, according to the indictment of 12 hackers from Russia's military intelligence agency known as the GRU.

Later in his July 2016 news conference, NBC News' Katy Tur asked Trump whether it was a problem to ask a foreign country to interfere in the election and hack an opponent's emails.

""I'd like to have them released,"" Trump said. ""No, it gives me no pause ... if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.""",2019,03,05,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/politics/trump-emails-joke/index.html
newyorker,Adam Schiff Hires a Former Prosecutor to Lead the Trump Investigation,"Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has hired a veteran prosecutor with experience fighting Russian organized crime to lead his investigation of the Trump Administration. Last month, according to a committee source, Daniel Goldman, who served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 2007 to 2017, joined the committee’s staff as a senior adviser and the director of investigations.

The hiring of Goldman, who will be joined by two other former federal prosecutors on Schiff’s staff, underlines Schiff’s decision to conduct an aggressive investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia during the 2016 Presidential campaign. In the rough division of labor among the various committees in the House of Representatives, Schiff’s panel is tackling the most provocative and, so far, most elusive subject related to the President: whether so-called collusion occurred between the Trump campaign and Moscow. In public comments, Schiff has suggested that Trump’s interest as a private citizen in building a tower in Moscow led him to curry favor with Vladimir Putin, the Russian President. American intelligence agencies long ago concluded that the Russian government made significant efforts, through the hacking of e-mails and use of social media, to help elect Trump over Hillary Clinton. The question of whether the Trump campaign facilitated, assisted, or knew about these efforts has been at the heart of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller—and will also be central to Schiff’s inquiry.

Goldman seems well suited to lead this effort. As deputy chief of the organized-crime section of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office, Goldman supervised the prosecution of more than thirty defendants accused of racketeering, gambling, and money laundering. During his decade in the office, Goldman convicted individuals associated with Russian organized crime of securities fraud and health-care fraud, and convicted leading figures in the Genovese crime family of racketeering and murder.

One of Schiff’s previous committee hires drew a critical comment from the President. Last month, Schiff hired Abigail C. Grace, who served as an Asia-policy staffer on the National Security Council during the early part of the Trump Administration. In response, President Trump tweeted that the Democrats were going “nuts” and that Schiff was “stealing people who work at the White House.” In response, Schiff pointed out that congressional committees often employ individuals with experience in the executive branch.

The conflict between Trump and Schiff dates back to well before the Democrat took over as the chair of the Intelligence Committee, after the midterm elections. In a tweet, Trump once rendered Schiff’s name as “Schitt,” and, in his recent speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the President bestowed the congressman with the nickname Shifty Schiff.

Goldman’s hiring comes amid a flurry of investigative activity by Democrats on Capitol Hill. Schiff and Representative Maxine Waters, the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, have agreed to coördinate an investigation of Trump’s long-standing ties to Deutsche Bank, which has paid multimillion-dollar penalties for facilitating the work of Russian money launderers. On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jerrold Nadler, revealed that it had demanded testimony and documents from eighty-one people and entities close to Trump relating to the issues of obstruction of justice and abuse of power. And, of course, Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, gave damning testimony to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week. All of these investigations appear to be much closer to the beginnings of their efforts than their ends.",0,0,0,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/adam-schiff-hires-a-former-prosecutor-to-lead-the-trump-investigation
usatoday,Trump will visit Alabama to meet with tornado victims,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said he will travel to Alabama on Friday to visit with the victims of a devastating tornado that killed at least 23 people.

The tornado was part of a powerful storm system that ripped through parts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia over the weekend. The area had been warned of possible tornadoes days before the storm, but some Alabama residents were warned only eight to nine minutes before the killer twister struck.

""I'll be heading to Alabama on Friday,"" Trump said during a veterans event at the White House. ""It's been a tragic situation. But a lot of good work is being done.""

Trump has made several trips to visit with the victims of natural disasters in recent months, including to California after last year's wild fires and to the Carolinas following Hurricane Florence.

Alabama: Storm-battered state could see more severe weather this weekend

Tornado victims: 6-year-old boy is youngest victims of Alabama tornado that left 23 dead

The president was expected to travel to his resort in Florida this weekend to attend a fundraiser. Further details of his Alabama trip were not immediately available, and the White House has generally kept a close hold on schedule details for such trips until the president is on the ground.

Trump said he’s been in touch with the governors of Alabama and Georgia since the tornado struck.

Authorities in Alabama released the names of the 23 victims of Sunday's tornado, including seven in one family, while meteorologists warned that another blast of severe weather could roar through the region in coming days.

usatoday,Trump ramps up effort to prevent veteran suicides with executive order creating task force,"CLOSE Cliff Bauman says he still has tough days, but he's learned how to deal with his PTSD. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday amping up efforts to prevent veteran suicide.

Veterans are 1.5 times more likely than non-veterans to take their lives, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and 20 die by suicide on average each day.

The order creates a Cabinet-level task force led by VA Secretary Robert Wilkie that will coordinate and align efforts across the federal government to help stem the crisis among former service members.

The panel will be tasked with creating a national plan to more effectively lower the numbers of veteran suicides after numerous programs and billions of dollars allocated to address the problem in recent years have had minimal impact.

""Veteran suicide is a tragedy of staggering proportions,"" Trump said at a signing ceremony. ""Today, we can help end this crisis.""

The initiative is dubbed the ""President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide"" – or the PREVENTS Initiative.

The plan will include prioritizing related research, encouraging collaboration with the private sector and developing a proposal to offer grants to state and local governments to support efforts to prevent veteran suicide.

""We're going to take care of our veterans – we're working so hard on this. We're going to take care of them like never before,"" Trump said, calling them ""our single greatest national treasure.""

""They kept us safe, and we're going to keep them safe,"" he said.

The order follows a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released in November that found VA suicide-prevention outreach “dropped off” since Trump took office. That included fewer social-media postings, public service announcements and advertisements. The agency spent only $57,000 of more than $6 million that had been budgeted for ads.

“We also found that VA did not have clear goals for evaluating the effectiveness of its outreach activities,” the GAO found.

The VA attributed the drop-off in outreach to leadership changes and a realignment of suicide-prevention efforts. The agency identified veteran suicide as its highest clinical priority last year and released a 10-year strategy to address the crisis.

From 2008 through 2016, more than 6,000 veterans took their lives each year – totaling more than 54,000 deaths.

In April 2017, former Navy SEAL Ryan Larkin became one of them.

The 29-year-old had deployed twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan before leaving the service in 2016, and he struggled to return to civilian life when he got home.

""Ryan kept saying that something was wrong with his head, but nobody was listening,"" his father, Frank, said during remarks with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

Frank Larkin said after his son's death, researchers discovered he had been suffering from a traumatic brain injury caused by exposures to blasts in training and on the battlefield.

He praised the president's order, specifically the aspects furthering research, and urged anyone struggling now not to lose hope.

""We will find a better way,"" Frank Larkin said. ""Failure is not an option.""

Veterans needing help can call the VA crisis line by dialing 800-273-8255 and selecting option 1. They can also send a text message to 838255, or chat with counselors online.

Opinion: I survived combat in Iraq and a suicide attempt at home. But many veterans aren't so lucky.

More: Suicide never entered his mind. Then 9/11 happened.

More: Authorities locate the suicidal veteran James Woods used Twitter to help

More: Suicide rate up 33 percent in less than 20 years, yet funding lags behind other top killers

cnn,President Trump's White House doesn't invite women's sports champions,"Washington (CNN) In the more than two years since President Donald Trump took office, he has not hosted a women's championship sports team for a solo event at the White House.

As the Post points out, there has yet to be an event during the Trump administration honoring a women's team on its own.

WNBA teams were frequently invited to the White House during the Obama, Bush, and Clinton administrations. NCAA women's basketball champion teams have visited the White House for the previous five administrations. But the Trump administration has yet to host a women's championship team at the White House, with the exception of a November 2017 event honoring multiple NCAA championship teams.

Female athletes were represented at the White House at that event, including the University of Maryland's women's lacrosse team, the University of Utah's co-ed ski team, West Virginia University's co-ed rifle team, the McKendree University women's bowling team, the University of Washington women's rowing team, University of Oklahoma softball team and the Penn State women's rugby team.

But, according to The Washington Post's reporting, the past two WNBA champions -- the Minnesota Lynx in 2017 and the Seattle Storm in 2018 -- were not invited to the White House, nor was the Notre Dame 2018 championship women's basketball team.

The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment on The Washington Post report nor did they respond to inquiries on whether invitations to solo events have been extended to any women's championship team at the college or professional level.

Trump has hosted male athletes several times over the course of his presidency, a tradition that gained momentum during the Reagan administration, per the Post. There have been events honoring the Clemson and Alabama men's football teams, 2017 Super Bowl champ New England Patriots, the Stanley Cup-winning Washington Capitals hockey team and NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series champion Martin Truex, among others.

On Monday, Trump became the first president since Bill Clinton, per the Post, to host a college team that won a title in the NCAA's secondary division, welcoming the FCS division championship North Dakota State Bison to the White House.

Trump seemed to acknowledge Monday that it was unusual to invite the team to the White House.

Pointing to the North Dakota Congressional delegation, Trump said, ""Your two great senators and a couple of others -- but these two guys, they really said, 'Would it be possible to do this for this team?' And I said -- you know, I watched your championship game. I said, ""Those guys are good. They deserve it. They really deserve it.' You are special.""

Coming to the White House has been a controversial political decision for some invited teams during the Trump administration.

When the White House hosted that 2017 event, the South Carolina women's basketball team declined the invitation

Last year, Trump canceled a visit from the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles team.

""The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,"" Trump said in a statement at the time. ""They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country. The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.""

And the NBA champion Golden State Warriors declined an invitation from the President to visit the White House after winning the 2017 championship.

vox,"“Remain in Mexico”: Trump’s quietly expanding crackdown on asylum seekers, explained","The Trump administration’s latest effort to repel asylum seekers has been quietly successful. And now it’s quietly expanding.

Since late January, the Trump administration has turned back some Central American asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. It’s an unprecedented response to what the Trump administration sees as its biggest problem: the fact that growing numbers of people are coming to the US without papers who can’t be summarily detained and deported.

By returning them to wait in Mexico, the administration is allowing them to pursue court cases in the US without actually admitting them.

Over the past month, the new policy ramped up slowly at a single border crossing. Now the unofficial pilot program is over, and the wider adoption of returns to Mexico has begun.

On Tuesday, according to multiple sources who were not authorized to speak to press, the US will return some asylum seekers to Mexico who had entered the US illegally, were apprehended by Border Patrol agents, and sought asylum. Since many more asylum seekers enter between ports of entry than are allowed to enter at official crossings, this could vastly expand the number of migrants forced to wait in Mexico under the new policy.

It’s a fundamental shift in the policy of asylum — which is generally, in US law, a legal protection you claim while on American soil. Instead, many migrants will have to wait in underfunded shelters in Tijuana or overcrowded ones in Ciudad Juarez — cities that aren’t necessarily safe for anyone right now, and where Central American migrants can be particularly vulnerable. (Trump administration officials have responded to this concern by protesting that US cities like Chicago are dangerous too.) US lawyers fear this will make already difficult asylum cases even harder because they can’t provide competent counsel to people in a different country.

Very few Trump administration immigration policies have been in effect for this long without inspiring widespread outrage or getting put on hold by the courts. But the quiet rollout of the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” as the Trump administration calls the program, and the many unanswered questions about the process have made it harder for advocates to attract the attention of American liberals.

In court, meanwhile — despite the many questions the new policy raises about both US and international law — the advocates who have challenged it are still fighting to get a federal judge to put the policy on hold. It is possible this is a legal battle the Trump administration could eventually win.

1) What is the US’s new policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico?

Migrants traveling from Central America through Mexico have a legal right to seek asylum in the US. And that right is triggered when they set foot on US soil — which is traditionally where they stay until their cases are resolved.

Under the new policy, though, when migrants present themselves to Customs and Border Protection agents to seek asylum, they’re given a date in a US immigration court 45 days in the future to start their asylum case, and then turned over to Mexican authorities to stay in Mexico until the 45 days are up.

The policy, which the Trump administration calls the “Migrant Protection Protocols” and others call the “Remain in Mexico” policy, applies only to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador (the countries dominating the current flow of families and asylum seekers), and isn’t being used for children trying to enter the US without an adult.

It relies on a rarely used provision in immigration law, which allows the US to return certain people who enter from a “contiguous territory” to be returned to that contiguous territory until their claim for legal status is either accepted or denied. (Whether asylum seekers are covered by the “contiguous territory” provision is at the heart of the lawsuit against the policy.)

Officially, the return-to-Mexico policy is a unilateral decision being made by the US; in practice, of course, it’s happening with the cooperation of the Mexican government.

For the first month, the policy wasn’t in effect along most of the US-Mexico border. But the administration has promised to expand it — and the expansion has now begun.

The return of some migrants who entered the US between ports of entry on Tuesday in San Diego is a huge change. It’s the first return of migrants who entered the US “without inspection” (committing the misdemeanor of illegal entry) and were apprehended by Border Patrol agents.

In the coming weeks, the US is expected to return more of those “entries without inspection” in the San Diego sector of the border, as well as, possibly, the El Paso sector — which also covers much of rural New Mexico. It’s also expected to start returning Central American asylum seekers who enter some of the other busy ports along the border (possibly including Calexico, California, and Eagle Pass, Texas).

2) Why is the Trump administration returning some asylum seekers to Mexico?

The Trump administration sees pretty much any level of unauthorized migration into the US as unacceptable. And in recent years, an ever-growing share of people coming to the US without papers have been people the US can’t simply detain and deport: unaccompanied children, families, and asylum seekers.

Many of these people don’t ultimately get approved for asylum. Some of them have their claims denied. Some don’t actually file an asylum application, or some don’t show up to court — although evidence suggests this might often be due to people simply falling through the cracks.

The Trump administration has made a concerted effort to reduce the number of people who are free in the US while their asylum claims are pending, so that it can quickly deport those who ultimately lose their cases. It tried several things over the course of 2018: taking in fewer asylum seekers at ports of entry, barring migrants who enter illegally from even applying for asylum, reducing asylum eligibility for victims of gang and domestic violence, making it much harder for asylum seekers to get released from detention, and separating families to keep parents in custody. It’s currently working to finalize a regulation that would allow for the detention of families during the months or years it took for their cases to be finalized.

Most of these efforts have been held up by judges — or, as in the case of the family detention regulation, are expected to face a stiff court challenge. The exception is the capacity reduction at ports of entry — which is essentially keeping asylum seekers waiting in Mexico. It’s both politically and legally trickier to muster opposition to a policy that is happening on foreign soil.

3) How exactly does this work?

The US can’t deport an asylum seeker without at least a screening interview to determine if they have a “credible fear” of persecution. And because about three-quarters pass their screening interviews, asylum seekers have traditionally been able to stay in the US while they wait for their cases to be resolved in court.

The new policy skips that process entirely. Instead of trying to deport immigrants without hearings, it promises them a hearing down the road — and “returns” them to Mexico to wait for those hearings in the meantime.

After a migrant is given notice to appear in immigration court, and a handout with free or low-cost legal providers licensed to practice in that court, they’re told to show up in San Ysidro in 45 days. Then they’re sent back south into the custody of the Mexican government.

Upon return, migrants are given visas by the Mexican government, generally humanitarian visas that allow them to live and work in Mexico for up to a year. Then they’re quickly shuttled into vans and sent to one of Tijuana’s migrant shelters — which don’t always get much notice before they’re expected to receive a group of returnees.

4) Does this violate the US’s humanitarian obligation toward asylum seekers?

The fundamental principle of international asylum law is that you can’t return a migrant to a country where they’re in danger of being persecuted, known as non-refoulement. That’s why the US has to give court hearings or at least screening interviews to people who enter claiming fear of persecution in their home countries.

The involvement of a third country — Mexico — doesn’t automatically let the US off the hook. (The US has a treaty with Canada in which each country is designated as a “safe third country” for asylum: Migrants who come through Canada will be turned away if they try to seek asylum in the US, and vice versa. Mexico hasn’t been willing to sign a version of this treaty.)

So the US is prohibited from returning migrants to Mexico if Mexico would return them to countries where they’d be persecuted. Mexico is assuring the US it won’t do that to migrants returned under the remain-in-Mexico policy — that’s why it’s giving visas to returnees who don’t already have them.

Mexico has also (in theory) refused to take back any migrants who are at risk of persecution in Mexico. But there are lots of questions about how the US is deciding that someone’s at risk.

Customs and Border Protection agents aren’t asking migrants if they are afraid of being returned to Mexico, like they do with normal asylum claims. Instead, migrants have to volunteer that information while they’re in initial processing — something that it’s not clear they would know how to do.

If a migrant does mention a fear of persecution in Mexico, she’s supposed to be referred to a US Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officer for an interview, as in a typical asylum claim. But in the typical asylum process, a migrant just has to establish a “credible fear” of persecution if returned to her home country — a deliberately generous standard. Under the new protocol, a migrant has to establish that she is “more likely than not” to be persecuted if she’s sent back to Mexico, a much tougher bar to meet.

During that interview, migrants don’t have access to a lawyer. (DHS says this is because of space constraints.) And in another divergence from standard procedure, the interviewer doesn’t make the final decision. All reports are referred to someone more senior at US Citizenship and Immigration Services for review.

It’s not clear how many migrants are being screened for fear in Mexico, and how many are passing those screenings. To human rights advocates, though, the difference between the new process and the typical way migrants’ fear is assessed is a red flag that some people with legitimate persecution claims might be falling into the gap.

5) How many people are actually being returned?

So far, the policy simply hasn’t affected that many people — but that is probably about to change.

From January 25 to February 28, only about 150 people were returned from the port at San Ysidro — a small fraction of the nearly 70,000 unauthorized immigrants who crossed the US-Mexico border (at or between ports of entry), according to preliminary DHS statistics for February.

But as the program expands to cover more of the border, there’s every reason to believe those numbers will rise — and quickly.

At ports of entry like San Ysidro, the federal government is able to limit how many asylum seekers it takes in a day to begin with — through a system called “metering” or “queue management” that some advocates claim is itself a violation of asylum law. They haven’t been returning many asylum seekers under the new policy, but they haven’t been taking many who are allowed to remain in the US, either.

The Trump administration is constantly running up against detention capacity and is extremely leery of releasing any asylum seekers into the US. Border Patrol agents have two choices: They can try to deport migrants without a court hearing, but those seeking asylum will then be entitled to a “credible fear” screening interview. Or they can simply give migrants court dates and detain (or release) them until then.

Given those options, taking the latter — and releasing them back to Mexico — likely is going to be the most attractive option.

6) Are people safe in Mexico while waiting?

President Trump loves to talk about how dangerous the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border is. But a fundamental principle of the US’s cooperation with Mexico to return Central American asylum seekers is that Mexico is a safe — or at least safe enough — place to wait.

When the US “unilaterally” announced it was starting returns to Mexico, the Mexican government stated it would ensure the safety of Central American migrants while they waited.

Migrants themselves, however, hardly feel safe. Tijuana is still trying to adjust to the large population of waiting asylum seekers (those who haven’t been admitted at the port yet, as well as returnees), while dealing with a drug-trade-induced crime wave.

One returnee, interviewed by Vox in Tijuana last month, said his friend had been harassed and robbed by police; when Vox asked if he felt safe in Tijuana, he answered, flatly, “No,” and started rattling off local homicide statistics. Another pair of asylum seekers still waiting to be allowed to enter the port (who could be returned under the new policy if the US chose), answered the same question by saying they didn’t go anywhere — they only left the migrant shelter to go to the supermarket, or to check each morning to see if their number had come up at the port.

As far as the US is concerned, this is simply not their problem. The Trump administration claims it’s meeting its obligation to migrants with its opt-in interview process, because its only obligation is to protect from persecution, not all types of danger.

But it’s very hard to tell the difference in practice between generic danger and persecution. Advocates and migrants both report that migrants in Tijuana are harassed (by criminals and police) because they are Central American migrants. The Trump administration won’t confirm that this would count as persecution that would allow a migrant to avoid MPP and stay in the US. Given that asylum officers are instructed to take the Mexican government’s written assurances of safety into account when determining if a migrant would be persecuted there, there’s no reason to believe it would be.

7) Why is the Mexican government going along with all this?

Officially, it’s not. The government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has insisted at every turn that it’s is a “unilateral” decision from the US, and that its only involvement is in agreeing to take migrants while they wait.

This isn’t really true. The question is how much Mexico is doing to collaborate.

The US was negotiating with López Obrador’s advisers over a return-to-Mexico policy before López Obrador was even inaugurated in December 2018. The morning the US announced it would invoke the “return to territory” provision, Mexico had a statement ready promising to receive returnees and keep them safe.

Maybe Mexico is both collaborating and resisting. In general, the arm of the government announcing cooperation with the US on MPP has been the foreign ministry, led by Marcelo Ebrard, a close adviser to the president. But actual implementation of migration policy falls to the interior ministry, led by Olga Sánchez Cordero, which has been much less enthusiastic about it.

Generally, the assumption among US-Mexico watchers is that the López Obrador government is buying goodwill on migration so that it can get more out of Trump on other issues like trade — ensuring that the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is ratified, for example. (In reality, it is not at all clear that Congress is paying attention to Mexico’s cooperation on immigration, or would make its decision about USMCA on that basis.) Ultimately, though, why it’s going along is a matter of speculation; that it is going along is not.

8) Is this legal?

A group of advocates led by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center has sued in federal court to stop the returns of asylum seekers. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedures Act by putting a new policy in place without issuing any regulations governing it. (That claim is strengthened by the fact that the US invented a new screening procedure to determine fear of persecution in Mexico — which advocates also accuse of violating the US’s commitment to non-refoulement under international law.)

Most important, though, is the question of whether US law allows asylum seekers to be returned to Mexico to begin with.

The section of US law that the Trump administration is using to justify the policy hasn’t really been used before on any significant scale. And it’s not clear whether it actually applies to asylum seekers. The statute is split into three parts, and it’s not clear which part encompasses the others.

Some immigration law experts argue that asylum seekers clearly aren’t allowed to be returned to a “contiguous territory.” But others — even those not inclined to be favorable to the administration — acknowledge it could go either way.

It’s more similar to the ambiguity of the travel ban — a policy on which the Supreme Court agreed to defer to the executive — than to some of the administration’s more legally questionable policies, like the thwarted asylum ban.

9) Will this just go the way of Trump’s other fights with the courts?

Even the travel ban initially got held up in court in California. So did the asylum ban, family separation, the family separation policy, efforts to restrict grant funding to so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions, and the effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trump’s distrust of the “liberal Ninth Circuit” appears to be mutual.

Yet MPP has been in effect for more than a month. It’s expanding. And it hasn’t yet been put on hold.

The secrecy and opacity around MPP has made it harder to sue over the program. Advocates didn’t want to file a lawsuit before MPP went into effect, because they didn’t know what they were arguing against until they could see it happening on the ground. Because of that, when the litigators (led by the ACLU and SPLC) asked the courts for an immediate “temporary restraining order” stopping the program, the judge said it wouldn’t be appropriate to restrain a policy already in effect — and made the ACLU and the government agree to a schedule to consider a slightly less immediate “preliminary injunction” instead. Briefings on that are scheduled to conclude this week.

But even now, the lack of information about (in particular) the “fear in Mexico” screenings makes it very hard for a judge to rule that MPP meets the standard of apparent illegality needed for a preliminary injunction. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to get the case moved to a different court — one that might rule that immigration advocacy organizations have no right to sue on behalf of asylum seekers who aren’t yet their clients and dismiss the case entirely.

Perhaps most importantly, the involvement of the Mexican government — however coerced it might be — distinguishes this from other Trump immigration policies. Immigration policy always overlaps somewhat with foreign policy; that’s one big reason the courts have traditionally deferred to the executive branch on the issue. But in this case, the foreign policy angle is explicit. It’s central to the policy. And US courts are extremely wary of reviewing foreign policy.

It is of course generally a bad idea to bet that federal judges in California will side with Trump on immigration. But it’s also a bad idea to assume that because judges have generally stopped Trump’s immigration policies, MPP will meet the same fate. It might, quietly, be the Trump administration’s most sweeping success in keeping asylum seekers out of the US.",2019,03,05,https://www.vox.com/2019/3/5/18244995/migrant-protection-protocols-border-asylum-trump-mexico
washingtonpost,Trump vowed ‘A Plus’ relief for Alabama. That’s not what California and Puerto Rico heard.,"After the deadliest outbreak of tornadoes in years swept through the South, killing more than 20 people and wreaking devastation in Alabama, President Trump promised on Twitter that the disaster relief would be swift, the best his administration could muster — “A Plus treatment” for a state in dire need.

“FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes,” Trump wrote Monday, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s relief efforts.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R), who said she spoke to Trump, thanked him for the support.

FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!). — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2019

But elsewhere — in corners of the country also hard-hit by natural catastrophes — some leaders may have privately wondered: What about us?

Trump’s enthusiastic assurance that Alabama would get top-flight help contrasts sharply with his barbed rhetoric following horrific wildfires in California and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, when he repeatedly threatened to cut off federal aid and picked fights with local politicians, in one instance calling the mayor of San Juan “totally incompetent.""

The difference between Alabama and Puerto Rico and California, the president’s critics say, is obvious.

“The president really treats differently those people who have supported him in the past and those people who haven’t,” Brian Ott, a rhetoric professor at Texas Tech University, told The Washington Post. “Not all lives are equal in the eyes of the president. … The lives of red states matter, and the lives of blue states don’t.""

It comes down to politics, said Ott, author of “The Twitter Presidency: Donald J. Trump and the Politics of White Rage.” In the 2016 election, Trump lost California by 30 percentage points. In Puerto Rico, which does not have a say in the presidential election, voters chose Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) over Trump in the Republican primary.

But Trump won Alabama by nearly 28 points.

“The president has politicized recovery efforts in a way we’ve never seen before,” Rafael Lemaitre, who was FEMA’s director of public affairs during the Obama administration, said in an interview. “FEMA needs to be as much of an apolitical agency as possible. It shouldn’t matter whether you live in a red state or a blue state.”

Observers noted a pattern in Trump’s past statements: for liberal leaders in disaster-stricken areas, criticism and intimidation.

In January, Trump leveled an attack against California officials who were battling the aftermath of a spate of forest fires that burned through hundreds of thousands of acres, destroyed thousands of structures and killed scores of people last year. He accused the state of mismanaging its forests and said, without evidence, that California wouldn’t need aid if it took better care of them.

The president then issued an ominous warning: “Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money.”

Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019

Months earlier, before the deadly Camp and Woolsey fires, Trump gave the state a similar ultimatum.

“California, get on the ball,” he said during a conference for local officials from Alaska, Hawaii and California. “Because we’re not going to hand you any more money. It’s ridiculous, okay?”

(The Post has reported it’s unclear whether the president even has the authority to rescind already-approved FEMA funds.)

In October 2017, Trump also threatened to abandon Puerto Rico at the height of a humanitarian crisis after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In what was then an extraordinary remark by an American president, Trump warned that relief workers would not stay in the U.S. territory “forever.”

“We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” he tweeted.

...We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017

At the time, the Trump administration faced intense criticism for its underwhelming response to the destruction. During a visit to the island, the president complained that the recovery efforts had “thrown our budget a little out of whack” and tossed rolls of paper towels at residents as if he was shooting free throws. He told his chief of staff at the time, John F. Kelly, that “he did not want a single dollar going to Puerto Rico, because he thought the island was misusing the money and taking advantage of the government,” The Post reported.

The president would go on to dispute the number of people who died in the months after Hurricane Maria made landfall and falsely suggest that Democrats had inflated the toll.

This week, after another one of the worst disasters in recent U.S. history, some commenters denounced Trump’s divergent responses.

“We’re glad Trump is devoting the full resources of FEMA to the people of Alabama after the devastating tornadoes ripped through people’s homes,” tweeted Eugene Gu, a surgeon and one of the Twitter users who sued Trump after the president’s personal account blocked him. “But when other states experienced similar disasters, Trump was totally careless and even mean. The stark contrast is pretty cruel.”

“Wish we had a President who gives the A plus treatment to everyone who loses their families and homes whether they are Republican, Democrat, or Independent,” Gu added.

politico,Awkward: How Trump’s past donations could haunt 2020 Dems,"President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump both donated across the political spectrum over the years. | Molly Riley-Pool/Getty Images 2020 elections Awkward: How Trump’s past donations could haunt 2020 Dems Donations from Trump and his family add another wrinkle to a Democratic primary where candidates are trumpeting their distance from the president.

Kamala Harris received money from Donald Trump as recently as six years ago. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner hosted a Park Avenue fundraiser for Cory Booker. Kirsten Gillibrand took in Trump family donations three times across a seven-year period — and then gave a similar amount of money to a nonprofit years later after the president mocked her in a tweet.

As the president gears up for his re-election fight, donor records show that six of the declared or potential Democrats itching to take him on have themselves been the beneficiaries of his — or his daughter’s — largesse.

Story Continued Below

Harris, Booker and Gillibrand — along with Joe Biden, John Kerry and Terry McAuliffe — all share a common bond of receiving Trump family donations, adding another wrinkle to a crowded primary where candidates are expected to trumpet their distance from the president.

An ideological shapeshifter whose decades in the public eye have spanned stints as a Republican, Democrat, Reform Party candidate and independent, Trump has donated across the spectrum from the establishment left to the far right. The recipients include both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and politically exiled Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).

Many of Donald Trump’s donations fall into two categories: contributions to local pols and officials with whom he wanted to curry favor, or one-offs to prominent players on the national stage.

But he strayed outside his usual New York and New Jersey turf to give Harris two donations totaling $6,000 in 2011 and 2013, when she was already considered a rising Democratic star as California attorney general.

Those were two of several contributions he made to state attorneys general who were investigating or had previously investigated Trump University.

Harris also landed $2,000 from Ivanka Trump for her re-election campaign, and another $2,000 from future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when she ran for Senate in 2016.

Trump historians who have studied his family and real estate career said he learned his political worldview from his father — and in a New York City industry where greasing politicians for favorable zoning exemptions or tax abatements was par for the course.

“This was completely irrespective of anything to do with principles, political perspectives,” said Gwenda Blair, a Columbia University journalism professor who wrote “The Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire.” “It was about levers of power, period. And this has not changed. This has never changed.”

Spokespeople for the Trump re-election campaign, Biden and McAuliffe declined to comment on the record. Other campaigns did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Harris campaign told The Sacramento Bee that Harris gave away the $6,000 from Donald Trump to a nonprofit in 2015 — and that she never met with him or gave him special treatment.

Whether their prior financial entanglements could surface as attack lines against Trump or any of these Democrats remains to be seen. In 2016, Trump won over crowds by insisting that his wealth inoculated him from undue external pressures. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried to turn Trump’s contributions to Harris and other California Democrats into a cudgel, but Trump was already cruising to the nomination by the state’s late primary.

During the primary campaign, in fact, Trump touted his donations to opponents. “It’s interesting: I was looking at the ones I’m running against. I’ve contributed to most of them. Can you believe it?” he said in an Iowa stop. “I’ve given to Democrats. I’ve given to Hillary. I’ve given to everybody! Because that was my job. I gotta give to them. Because when I want something, I get it. When I call, they kiss my ass.”

Clinton, on the other hand, took tremendous flak for her sources of money, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) bashed her repeatedly for giving paid speeches to Wall Street firms. And with the Democratic Party’s insurgency on the left this year — and a long list of contenders for the nomination — financial litmus tests could once again come into play.

Harris, for one — among the early front-runners and a lightning rod for some Twitter backers of Sanders — has attracted some negative liberal attention for her donations from Trump and Mnuchin. The Black Socialists of America tweeted disapprovingly; a meme popped up last month.

Nobody in the burgeoning Democratic 2020 field has taken as much from the Trumps as McAuliffe and Booker. McAuliffe landed $25,000 from Trump in his failed Virginia gubernatorial primary bid in 2009. (He won four years later.)

Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, now top advisers to the president, each sent Booker $10,400 in 2013. They bundled $41,000 and hosted a fundraiser for his Senate campaign that year.

Kushner hails from a prominent New Jersey Democratic family; his brother, Joshua, made identical donations to Booker. (Joshua Kushner has also given to former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Rep. Seth Moulton, who are both considering White House runs.)

But in the wake of Trump’s 2016 election, some Democrats began to look askance at the money they once took from his family.

In 2017, Booker reflected on the support from Ivanka Trump and Kushner in an interview with BuzzFeed’s “Another Round” podcast. The headline: “Booker Doesn’t Regret Fundraising With Jared And Ivanka In 2013, But ‘Wouldn’t Take A Dime From Them Now.’”

Harris isn’t the only candidate to have rid herself of Trump’s money. Trump gave Gillibrand $5,850 across three donations in 2007 and 2010. And the New York senator took $2,000 from Ivanka Trump in 2014.

But in December 2017, Gillibrand gave the $5,850 away to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network after Trump tweeted that she “would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them).” She turned the moment into some of her best-ever fundraising days.

Not all of Trump’s donations as directly reflected angling for his self-interest. He gave Biden, then a senator from Delaware, a $1,000 gift in 2001.

Kerry, a more peripheral figure in 2020 speculation who has nonetheless said he’s mulling a bid, landed $5,500 from Trump in seven donations spanning 1989 to 2003.

In one striking example, Trump made equal $2,000 donations to rivals Kerry and President George W. Bush — just eight days apart in June 2003.

“He’s a person who believes in nothing more than he believes in transactions,” said Michael D’Antonio, author of the 2015 Trump biography “Never Enough.” “So this was his down payment. And he didn’t care who won. Either way he was going to win. Because he was going to back the winner. And he’s not alone in that, I don’t think.”

Of course, the president’s past contributions to Democrats are nothing new. His repeated gifts to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation throughout the mid-2000s made hay when they battled for the presidency in 2016, but they didn’t derail either’s path to a party nomination.

In the 2008 presidential election, Trump sent money to Clinton, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Republican National Committee.

Trump himself has defended his donations to Democrats on much the same grounds: as simple realpolitik for a New York City real estate developer.

“Everyone’s Democratic,” he told Sean Hannity in 2011, when he was weighing a White House challenge to President Barack Obama. “So what am I going to do, contribute to Republicans? … I mean, one thing I’m not stupid.”",2019,03,05,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/05/2020-presidential-dems-trump-money-1202938
usatoday,President Trump's approval rating continues to climb,"CLOSE President Donald Trump on Saturday told an appreciative audience of conservatives that he'll win re-election in 2020 and by a bigger margin than he did in 2016. (March 2) AP

President Donald Trump's job approval numbers continue to climb, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.

After an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll published Monday put Trump's approval rating at 46 percent among registered voters, his RCP average rose to 44.4 percent, his highest mark since October 2018 following the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Trump's highest RCP average of his presidency was 46 percent, just after his inauguration. Two months later, it dropped below 44 percent and stayed there, only briefly returning above that level in May, June and October of 2018.

Despite that improvement, the numbers still indicate the president is vulnerable heading into the 2020 election.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 41 percent of registered voters plan to vote for Trump while 48 percent said they plan to vote for whoever ends up becoming the Democratic candidate. By contrast, at about this point in former President Barack Obama's presidency, 45 percent of voters said they planned to vote for Obama while 40 percent preferred a generic Republican candidate.

And Trump's disapproval rating remained high at 52 percent, although that was an improvement from the 54 percent the poll found in January and December.

When asked if it is more important that the 2020 Democratic nominee is able to defeat Trump than reflect their personal views on the issues, 40 percent of voters who plan to cast ballots in the Democratic primary said beating Trump is more important. Fifty-six percent said the candidate's policy positions are more important.

Trump's rising poll numbers come despite the record 35-day government shutdown, which most voters blamed on Trump, and opposition to his use of an emergency declaration to secure funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Last month, Trump touted a 52 percent approval rating from a Feb. 19 poll by Rasmussen Reports.

""93% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 52% Approval Rating overall! Not bad considering I get the most unfair (BAD) press in the history of presidential politics! And don’t forget the Witch Hunt!"" Trump tweeted.

93% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 52% Approval Rating overall! Not bad considering I get the most unfair (BAD) press in the history of presidential politics! And don’t forget the Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2019

Trump regularly shares the results from Rasmussen, which tends to place his approval rating a few points higher than other polling outfits. Since the Feb. 19 poll, Trump approval rating on Rasmussen has gone down to 47 percent, however.

The poll was conducted from Feb. 24 to 27, so it does not necessarily reflect the impact if any, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen's testimony to Congress might have on Trump's approval rating. Cohen called the president a ""racist,"" a ""liar"" and a ""cheat,"" and implicated the president in a number of illegal acts.

theguardian,Michael Bloomberg rules himself out of 2020 presidential bid – live,"13:45

The House judiciary, oversight, foreign affairs and intelligence committees made headlines on Monday, with requests for documentation from and interviews with key figures throughout Trumpworld.

Today, ABC News reports that the ways and means committee is seeking to construct an “air-tight” legal strategy by which to compel Donald Trump to release his personal tax returns for the last 10 years.

The committee has the authority to request the documents from the US treasury, but member Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, told ABC the matter will most likely “be fought out in the courts, and then possibly the supreme court”.

“They weren’t going to simply take the letter and agree to it,” he said.

Presidential candidates have for years released tax records by convention, but not by compunction. As a candidate, Trump said he was under an audit and would release his tax returns after that. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he never did.

In testimony to the oversight committee last week which ABC said had increased pressure on the ways and means committee, former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen said he presumed Trump had not been under audit. Trump did not want his returns released, Cohen said, because he “didn’t want an entire group of think tanks, who are tax experts, to run through his returns”. Cohen also said Trump bragged that he did not pay taxes.

Most observers think Trump’s tax returns hold vital information for those eager to investigate him and as such, to Trump’s opponents, they have become a sort of Holy Grail.

There have been glimpses, among them:

In October 2016, a month before the election, the New York Times used parts of Trump’s 1995 tax return to say he might not have paid federal income tax for 18 years.



In March 2017, MSNBC got hold of two pages of Trump’s 2005 return, which contained no explosive information.



In October 2018, the Times released a bumper report on Trump family tax schemes.

But there has been no sign of the motherlode.

Here’s a link to a Guardian column by David Cay Johnston, expert Trump-watcher and the source of the MSNBC report, which we published after the 2018 Times investigation:

cnbc,Michael Cohen's attorney approached Trump's lawyers about a pardon: WSJ,"An attorney for Michael Cohen raised the idea of a pardon with President Donald Trump's lawyers after federal authorities raided Cohen's residence and office in April, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the talks.

Congress is now investigating those conversations, documents requested by the House Judiciary Committee revealed on Monday, the Journal said.

The pardon discussions happened as Cohen's attorney at that time, Stephen Ryan, was working with Trump's lawyers to determine whether documents seized by the FBI during the April raid were protected by attorney-client privilege, sources told the Journal.

The report comes days after Cohen told lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week that he never asked for a pardon from Trump, and that he would not accept one. The Journal article noted there was no evidence that Cohen himself asked for a pardon or was aware of the alleged pardon discussions.

Trump's lawyers – including Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani and Joanna Hendon – dismissed the idea of a pardon at the time, the sources said, according to the Journal. But the paper also reported that Giuliani left open the possibility of an eventual presidential pardon.

Ryan also approached attorneys for the Trump Organization, the president's company, about a pardon, the Journal reported. Ryan no longer represents Cohen in the criminal case.

If a pardon was not an option, Ryan left the impression that his client Cohen might flip and cooperate with investigators from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, the paper added.

Ryan and a spokesperson for Giuliani did not return CNBC's requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for Cohen told CNBC in an email, ""Mr. Cohen stands by his testimony before the House Oversight Committee.""

In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges, including two campaign finance violations for arranging hush money payments during the 2016 campaign to two women – porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal – who alleged they had sexual trysts with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affairs.

Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. He will report to prison May 6, when he is slated to begin a three-year sentence.

vanityfair,Trump’s Dumb Trade War Cost Americans $3 Billion a Month Last Year,"Here are some things Donald Trump has said about his trade war with China since first hitting Beijing with tariffs last March, a move supported exclusively by his craziest advisers that caused National Economic Council director Gary Cohn to sprint across the South Lawn of the White House and hail the next cab back to New York:

“Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people.” (August 2018);

“Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China” (November 2018);

“The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly” (January 2019);

“Trade negotiators have just returned from China where the meetings on Trade were very productive. Now at meetings with me at Mar-a-Lago giving the details. In the meantime, Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs!” (February 2019)

He says these things because he doesn’t actually have any idea how tariffs work, despite having it explained to him numerous times—which in itself is a great reason to follow the directions on the box of Just for Men, and wash it out before it seeps into your brain. If he did, he’d tweet something like, “Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by Americans in the form of Trade Tariffs!,” because in reality, U.S. companies and consumers are the ones who’ve paid for his little trade war. And according to two studies published over the weekend, they’ve paid a lot!

In a study published on Saturday, economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University found that tariffs imposed last year by Trump on products ranging from washing machines and steel to some $250 billion in Chinese imports were costing U.S. companies and consumers $3 billion a month in additional tax costs and companies a further $1.4 billion in deadweight losses. They also were causing the diversion of $165 billion a year in trade leading to significant costs for companies having to reorganize supply chains.

In a separate paper published on Sunday, four economists including Pinelopi Goldberg, the World Bank’s chief economist and a former editor in chief of the prestigious American Economic Review, put the annual losses from the higher cost of imports alone for the U.S. economy at $68.8 billion.

“This is kind of the worst-case scenario in terms of consumers,” Columbia University professor David Weinstein told Bloomberg. “It’s pretty unclear that this trade war is a net win for the economy at this point.” Moreover, as Paul Krugman points out, the fact that consumers are paying for the trade war is just one of several reasons why this whole thing ranks somewhere around Trump Airlines on a list of the president’s worst ideas:

By the way, in practice any manufacturing jobs added by the Trump tariffs are probably offset by losses of other manufacturing jobs. Partly that’s because most of the tariffs are on intermediate goods—inputs into production, so that job gains in, say, steel are offset by losses in autos and other downstream sectors. Beyond that, the tariffs have probably contributed to a rising dollar, which makes U.S. exports less competitive.

Meanwhile, Wall Street appears to be sick of the White House’s frequent pronouncements that a deal is just around the corner, which have so far proven empty. “After a while it feels like the boy who cried wolf,” R.J. Grant, director of equity trading at KBW Inc., told The Wall Street Journal. “The market can only rally so much on hope. We actually need tangible results. The rally has gotten a little bit long in the tooth, given the fact that we’re really not seeing much global growth.” On the bright side, reports suggest that a deal may be imminent. On the less-bright side, it’s not totally clear whether the results would justify the last year of pain:

Strategists have said the biggest market pop would come from a deal that peeled away tariffs but also included serious structural reforms on intellectual property and technology transfers. As per current discussions, China could possibly include language about state-owned enterprise subsidies and forced technology transfers, in to a new foreign investment law changing equity ownership rules. But sources tell CNBC, they are skeptical about how strong that language would be.

According to news reports, Beijing would also increase purchases of U.S. goods, a move that responds to Trump’s concern that it’s the trade deficit between the U.S. and China that needs to be fixed. The purchases would include $18 billion in natural gas from Cheniere Energy. But some worry that any deal will not have enough teeth for enforcement and the rules on technology would ring hollow. It also seems likely that any deal would still be followed by rounds of negotiations on some of the knottier issues.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials are reportedly worried that Trump’s failed summit with Kim Jong Un has resulted in sheer desperation. “His failure to get a deal in Vietnam increases the pressure on him to get a deal with the Chinese,” Fred Bergsten, founder of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, told the Journal. And if those singular negotiating skills we’ve heard so much about don’t magically appear in the next several weeks, just remember: it’s all Michael Cohen’s fault.

Report: Gary Cohn ignored Trump’s demands to use the D.O.J. to exact revenge on his media foes

In the midst of today’s bombshell New Yorker story detailing the various ways Fox News has functioned as Donald Trump’s “servile propaganda operation” comes this fun tidbit re: the president’s attempts to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger, a move that would have had the dual benefit of both hurting Fox’s competition and screwing Time Warner subsidiary CNN:

. . . in the late summer of 2017, a few months before the Justice Department filed suit, Trump ordered Gary Cohn, then the director of the National Economic Council, to pressure the Justice Department to intervene. According to a well-informed source, Trump called Cohn into the Oval Office along with John Kelly, who had just become the chief of staff, and said in exasperation to Kelly, “I’ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened! I’ve mentioned it 50 times. And nothing’s happened. I want to make sure it’s filed. I want that deal blocked!”

Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, evidently understood that it would be highly improper for a President to use the Justice Department to undermine two of the most powerful companies in the country as punishment for unfavorable news coverage, and as a reward for a competing news organization that boosted him. According to the source, as Cohn walked out of the meeting he told Kelly, “Don’t you fucking dare call the Justice Department. We are not going to do business that way.”

Cohn declined to comment to The New Yorker and Kelly did not respond to inquiries. While the Justice Department has repeatedly claimed that Trump did not involve himself in the suit, a former White House official told reporter Jane Mayer, “The president...wanted to bring down the hammer,” an observation seemingly confirmed by his many online meltdowns on the matter. And according to Kellyanne Conway’s husband, if it turns out that Trump did indeed force the lawsuit (which the D.O.J. lost, appealed, and lost for a second time last week), that would be a very bad thing for a president whose party no longer controls both chambers of Congress:

And speaking of Congress

House Dems sent out a whole bunch of interesting queries today:

House Democrats sent more than 80 letters Monday demanding documents from family members, business associates, political confidants, and others with connections to President Trump, opening a sprawling investigation of whether he and his administration have engaged in obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power.

The most far-reaching request since Democrats took control of the House underscored lawmakers’ determination to hold Trump and those around him accountable for controversies that have dogged the president during his first two years in office—and perhaps lay the grounds for impeachment proceedings. . . . The inquiry touched on a wide array of matters, from the president’s business dealings with Russia to the firing of former F.B.I. director James B. Comey to hush payments made to women. Many of those issues are already being examined by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York—not to mention other committees in the House.

Asked during his five-star dinner with North Dakota State’s championship football team if he plans to cooperate, Trump told reporters “I cooperate all the time with everybody,” adding that “the beautiful thing” is that there’s “no collusion . . . it’s all a hoax.” (He later repeated himself on Twitter just in case they didn’t hear it in the cheap seats.)

Lyft would prefer people to take a more chill approach to its near-billion-dollars worth of losses

When you think about investing in the company through its upcoming I.P.O., think of the $911 million it lost in 2018 as focus on the future:

The co-founders write, “We thoughtfully balance investments in growth and profitability considerations, while deliberately leaning more towards growth (especially in these early days).”

Expect Lyft to emphasize focus when speaking with prospective investors. It's a ride-hail company, growing at a faster clip than is Uber, and not too distracted by large side projects like food delivery and autonomous vehicle development.

It’s not clear how Uber fared for 2018 overall, but it lost $1.07 billion in the third quarter so Lyft is in good company.

Historian Anthony Scaramucci thinks London will be fine post-Brexit

“We were actually opening [our Skybridge London] office a week or two before the Brexit vote,” the asset manager turned White House communications director turned asset manager told City AM. “Somebody said to me, ‘Well, what if Brexit happens? Isn’t that going to change your decision? Wouldn’t you rather put it on the continent?’ I said, ‘No. The City of London has flourished for 500 years, with or without the economic union, with or without being in the E.U.’”

washingtonpost,The intractability of Ilhan Omar’s identity in Trump’s condemnation of her comments,"

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) arrives for President Trump's State of the Union address on Feb. 5. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)

President Trump’s two-hour speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday included any number of asides that, in normal times, might have prompted hours of cable-news commentary. Buried in those remarks was an aside that didn’t receive much attention — but with the renewed debate over comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that have been perceived as anti-Semitic, the aside is noteworthy.

Trump was explaining why he now says he supports an expansion of immigration.

“Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in,” he said. “We need workers to come in, but they’ve got to come in legally, and they’ve got to come in through merit, merit, merit.”

The enthusiastic crowd broke out into cheers of “U-S-A!”

“They’ve got to come in through merit,” Trump said. “They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country.

“We have people in Congress — right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country,” he continued. “And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It’s sad. It’s very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it’s very, very sad.

“Very, very — and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well?” Trump said. “Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, ‘Oh, that’s terrible that he brings that up.’ But that’s okay, I don’t mind. I’ll bring it up.

Who is this member of Congress who came from another country and who Trump believes “hates America”? Well, there are 14 members of Congress who are immigrants — and only one whom Trump lambasted during a Cabinet meeting last month.

“Congressman Omar is terrible, what she said,” Trump said at the time, referring to tweets from Omar that were criticized as anti-Semitic. “And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”

“What she said is so deep-seated in her heart that her lame apology — and that’s what it was; it was lame, and she didn’t mean a word of it — was just not appropriate,” Trump continued. “I think she should resign from Congress, frankly.”

Trump reinforced his opposition to Omar in a tweet on Monday night.

Representative Ilhan Omar is again under fire for her terrible comments concerning Israel. Jewish groups have just sent a petition to Speaker Pelosi asking her to remove Omar from Foreign Relations Committee. A dark day for Israel! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2019

That, it seems, followed his watching a segment on Fox News in which Sean Hannity called Omar his “villain of the day.” Earlier on Monday, an adviser to Trump’s campaign was on Fox Business Network, where the language he used was harsher.

“The problem is that her beliefs are deeply rooted in hatred and anti-Semitism,” Jeff Ballabon said. “She is a hater. I’m going to say it, she is filth. She has no place in the Congress.”

“She is a filthy, disgusting hater,” he later added. “So what if she’s in Congress?”

The most recent round of criticism of Omar stemmed from a tweet she offered in response to Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.). Lowey’s initial comment criticized a poster seen in the West Virginia State Capitol that linked Omar to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Such a link, Lowey wrote, was as painful and worthy of condemnation as Omar’s implication that Jewish Americans had dual loyalty with Israel.

“Our democracy is built on debate, Congresswoman!” Omar replied. “I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee. The people of the 5th elected me to serve their interest. I am sure we agree on that!”

The implication that others had mandated allegiance or pledges of support to Israel reinforced the criticism that Lowey was offering. Omar now faces a resolution on the House floor introduced by Democrats that condemns her comments, albeit indirectly. (It’s a move that’s clearly meant to stamp out the issue as much as to hold Omar to task.)

It’s impossible, though, to isolate Omar’s religion and identity from the criticism she faces, particularly from Trump.

Omar immigrated to the United States as a refugee from the civil war in Somalia that began in 1991. She left that country when she was 10, arriving in Virginia in 1995. How did she do in “her country,” to answer Trump’s question? Well, she was a child.

It’s worth remembering, too, that in Trump’s case, he once reportedly derided African nations as “s---hole” countries. At another point, he said that once Nigerian immigrants “had seen the United States, they would never ‘go back to their huts’ in Africa,” according to the New York Times.

Omar has spoken in the past of facing bullying because of her identity and the hijab that she wears. A 2017 survey of Muslims conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 64 percent of those who wore clothing that identified them as Muslim had faced discriminatory treatment.

More to the point, though, many Republicans see people who immigrate to the United States as not being “truly American.” A poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Atlantic found that 63 percent of Republicans believe that being “truly American” means having been born here. (Forty-three percent of Democrats agreed.) A quarter of Republicans think that being “truly American” necessitates being of Western European heritage. (In related news, Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, again retweeted a white nationalist on Monday. Trump has never openly criticized King.]

In response to another question in the PRRI poll, 40 percent of Republicans said they mostly preferred a Christian majority, while 12 percent said they mostly preferred religious diversity.

The sincerity of Trump’s condemnations of Omar is a question of its own. At an event hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in 2015, he predicted that Jewish donors in the room were not going to “support me because I don’t want your money.”

“That’s why you don’t want to give me money, okay?” Trump said. “But that’s okay. You want to control your own politician.”

If Trump had his way, Omar wouldn’t be in the country. “Merit” aside, his ban on travel from largely Muslim-majority countries included Somalia. What’s more, his administration has slashed the number of refugees allowed to enter the country each year, with one result being a 91 percent drop in the number of Muslim refugees admitted from 2016 to 2018. This despite the ongoing conflict in Syria, among other global issues.

Omar offered her own thoughts on Trump and her identity in a tweet on Sunday.

“My Americanness is questioned by the President and the @GOP on a daily basis, yet my colleagues remain silent,” Omar wrote. “I know what it means to be American and no one will ever tell me otherwise.”",2019,03,05,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/05/intractability-ilhan-omars-identity-trumps-condemnation-her-comments/
washingtonpost,Trump’s support among Hispanics and Latinos is real. Don’t assume it will fade.,"

President Trump speaks at the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit in March 2018 in Washington. (Evan Vucci/AP)

Data analyst and political columnist

Every few months, a strange thing happens in the news: President Trump says something negative about Hispanics and Latinos or makes a new push for his border wall. Someone then checks the polls and finds that his approval is well above zero percent with Hispanics and Latinos, and every journalist marvels that those numbers aren’t lower. Then, before we have time to fully examine why Trump’s numbers with these voters are where they are, some other event bursts into the news cycle like the Kool-Aid Man and we all move on without figuring out this seeming conundrum. A few months later, the pattern repeats.

We’re on the tail end of one of those loops right now. Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency in an effort to get the wall built prompted some to dive into his numbers among Hispanics. But other stories have started to crowd out wall news. Before the mystery of Hispanic and Latino support recedes from the news cycle again, I decided to comb through the existing data and research on these voters’ decision-making to try to figure out how many of them support Trump and get a sense of why they do.

The data suggests that Republicans have a substantial, semi-soft floor with Hispanic and Latino voters and that Trump has basically hit it. Moreover, this floor seems to built at least in part on identity and ideology, meaning that Democrats might not be able to eat into it by simply emphasizing immigration.

Finding the GOP’s floor

Trump often overstates his support among Hispanic and Latino voters — Democrats typically win the group by a wide margin, and Trump’s base among them isn’t huge. But it is there.

Recent YouGov, Quinnipiac and Post-ABC News polls put his approval rating among Hispanics at 27 percent, 23 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Those numbers average out to about 23 percent — that’s a substantial chunk, and it’s not so different from his 2016 vote share. According to demographers Ruy Teixeira, Rob Griffin and John Halpin, Trump won 29 percent of the Latino vote against Hillary Clinton in 2016.

That roughly 25-30 percent of figure shows up elsewhere in the data. Mitt Romney won about 30 percent of Latinos in 2012. Catalist, a Democratic firm, calculated that House Republicans lost the Latino vote by a 42-point margin in 2018 — which is similar to Clinton’s 47-point margin. Exit polls (which have their flaws) said that John McCain won 31 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2008. Republicans did somewhat better with Hispanics in the 2010 and 2014 midterms, and there have been some nerd fights over how well George W. Bush performed with Hispanics and Latinos in 2004. But in recent, high-turnout elections, Republicans seem to have hit some sort of floor around a quarter or a third of the Latino and Hispanic vote.

Why the floor is where it is

There’s one obvious reason that the Hispanic and Latino vote splits up and isn’t monolithic: Hispanic and Latino voters aren’t one identity homogeneous group. As with every other large racial and ethnic category (white, black, Asian), there’s a lot of internal diversity when you look under the hood.

Hispanic and Latino Americans, like Asian Americans, don’t all come from one place. Most originally come from Mexico, but a solid number come from Puerto Rico, Cuba and elsewhere in Central and South America. And voting patterns vary across these groups. Cubans, for example, are a key voting group in Florida, and they tend to be more Republican than other Latino populations. There are real generational divides: Self-identified Hispanics who are third-generation or higher are more likely than others to self-describe primarily as American rather than Hispanic/Latino, less likely to say they have felt discriminated against because of their background and feel less connected to their country of origin. Hispanics live in a wide variety of areas, and there’s some evidence that rural Hispanics moved a bit toward Trump in 2016. Evangelical Protestant Hispanics are more Republican than mainline Protestant, Catholic or religiously unaffiliated Hispanics. There’s a gender gap in Hispanic voting, too. Democrats won both Hispanic men and women in 2018, but Hispanic men were more likely to vote for Republicans than women were.

It’s true that most Hispanic and Latino voters are Democrats, but some of the same political beliefs and identities that motivate non-Hispanics and non-Latinos to become Republicans, including religion, gender and partisanship also influence Latinos and Hispanics. Roughly 30 percent of them are a consistent Republican base.

Immigration alone doesn’t seem to be a silver bullet for winning Hispanic and Latino votes. Before Trump entered the national political scene, Pew found that only 34 percent of Hispanic registered voters said immigration was “extremely important” to them personally. And in 2017, 46 percent of Latinos rated “dealing with the issue of immigration” as a top priority for Trump and the new Congress. Education, the economy, health care and other issues were more important to Latinos than immigration in both of these surveys. Even in times like these, when the parties are clearly divided by immigration, about 28 percent of Hispanic registered voters either lean toward the GOP or identify as Republicans. And as my former colleague Sean Trende showed in his great work on this subject, some Hispanics even hold hawkish views on immigration.

Republicans probably haven’t helped themselves with Latinos by taking a highly restrictionist position on immigration. Even more importantly, the perception that the party tolerates racist politicians, including Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), is a major obstacle to the party courting these voters. Many Hispanic and Latino voters do care about immigration, and Republicans could probably improve their approach by cooling down the rhetoric, trying to target their populist appeals in ways that explicitly help Hispanics and Latinos and thinking up an immigration policy that doesn’t involve pursuing a border wall at all costs. There’s a reason that Republicans often lose this group by 30 to 40 points.

But it is worth noting that Trump, the loudest immigration restrictionist the GOP has run in the modern era, hit the same floor as other Republicans. I’m not the first person to notice this, but it’s a key detail. It suggests that a conservative position on immigration isn’t radioactive to every Hispanic or Latino voter. Democrats who dream of locking up 90 percent of the Latino and Hispanic vote, turning them into a base comparable to African American voters, need to get over the idea that they can win that base just by emphasizing immigration.

To 2020 and beyond

Democrats might be able to push down the GOP’s floor over time, wait for progressive young Hispanics and Latinos to become more regular voters and eventually win by even greater margins than they’re winning now. Republicans might even help them do that by doubling down on harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric over the next few cycles.

That’s also not how the future has to unfold. Maybe over time, the meaning of the “Hispanic” and “Asian” labels will change as they did for many Irish, Italian and other voters and Republicans will gain more voters over time. Nate Cohn has pointed out that increasing numbers of Hispanics are identifying as white — suggesting that “Hispanic” (like most racial and ethnic categories in the United States) doesn’t have a fixed meaning. And maybe Hispanic and Latino identity will change in a way that lets Republicans eat into that 40-point Democratic margin. It’s too early to know what will happen — wonks on the right and left have been debating these points for years — but it’s not clear that Democrats will be able to effortlessly ride the growth of the Hispanic and Latino populations into an invincible majority.

As with lots of things Trump says, his insistence that “Hispanics love me” is overblown. Democrats still crush Republicans among nonwhite voters, and that’s a real problem for the GOP. But the president’s critics shouldn’t ignore Trump’s nonwhite support. Instead, Trump’s standing with Hispanic and Latino voters ought to deliver a sharp wake-up call to Democratic strategists. If a president who makes a border wall his signature and who demonizes immigrants from Latin American countries can still hold on to 30 percent of the voters most likely to be harmed by this rhetoric, Democrats are going to have to work harder to turn Hispanic and Latino voters into the base of their dreams.

cnn,The generational flaw in Trump's anti-socialism campaign,"(CNN) President Donald Trump clearly thinks he has a winning argument against Democrats in 2020 and it comes straight out of his Baby Boomer childhood.

Trump and other Republicans have spent the past few weeks arguing that Democrats would rob Americans of consumer comforts like cars and hamburgers, using a definition of socialism that borrows from a time when that ideology -- in the form of communism -- posed an actual existential threat in a nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union.

That's not the world Trump sees. When he riled up the young and conservative activists at this past weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump brought up ""socialism"" four separate times with four separate one-liners:

But Democrats are selling a softer socialism, leaning on government as the solution to soaring health care costs, widening inequality, and a new and more dangerous existential threat -- climate change -- that many fear is literally killing the earth.

Their audience is the portion of the electorate too young to remember the Cold War. Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born in October 1989, the month before the Berlin Wall fell and two years before the Soviet Union collapsed. This group's view of socialism is in the happy social media dispatches from Northern Europe, where child care is free, almost everyone has a job, health care is provided for and retirement is guaranteed.

Socialism is clearly having something of a moment in the US political discussion thanks to Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez, the main spokeswoman for the Green New Deal and for a more socialist Democratic party that would re-imagine the US economy as a way of combating climate change.

It also stems from the 2016 candidacy of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent running a second time as a Democrat on a brashly democratic socialist agenda. Sanders, by the way, is the only person currently running in the Democratic primary who calls himself a democratic socialist. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is considering a run, likes to call himself a progressive. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who like Sanders has a disdain for Wall Street and big banks, has said pretty clearly she considers herself a capitalist.

The question of the Democratic primary may very well end up being how much Democrats want to embrace the label of socialism and whether it will continue to be a dirty word in US politics.

Americans coming of age today and even those who have been voting in recent elections are more likely to have encountered socialism not via Russian communism, which is long gone, but from China's version, which is planted emphatically in the world marketplace, or from Northern Europe , where Sanders likes to points out the governments honor free markets but also take care of their citizens.

In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out Monday, just 18% of Americans had a positive view of socialism, 50% had a negative view and 26% had a neutral view. Capitalism, meanwhile, was the mirror opposite: 50% had a positive view, 19% had a negative view and 25% had a neutral view.

Worse for someone like Sanders is that voters were asked what might make them enthusiastic about a candidate. A ""socialist"" candidate drew the most skepticism. Four percent of registered voters said they'd be enthusiastic about a socialist candidate. Four! Widening that out, 25% said they'd be enthusiastic or comfortable and 72% said they'd be have reservations or be very uncomfortable.

But there's another important element to consider in terms of socialism. Most of the skepticism about socialism comes from older American generations. Trump's Baby Boomers -- he was born in 1946 at the beginning of the Baby Boom -- grew up under fear of nuclear fallout and seeing the Soviet Union as the main existential threat to the US.

Now, it is their distrust of socialism that Trump is banking on, even as those Boomers embrace the twin US government safety nets of Social Security and Medicare.

Less than a third of voters who are 65 and older have a positive view of socialism in Gallup polling from August 2018. That's remained steady since 2010.

Meanwhile, positive views of socialism among 18-29 year olds -- all born after the fall of the Soviet Union -- are much stronger at a steady 50% or so since 2010. And it support falls with each generation from there -- 41% positive among the general Millennial age group and 30% among the general Generation X age group.

That's important because of how many voters are in those younger age groups.

Voters older than 65 will be about 23% of the electorate in 2020, according to projections from Pew

Voters born after 1996, Generation Z, will be about 10% of eligible voters in 2020. Millennials will be about 27%.

Generation X, who were born between 1965 and 1980, and so have very real memories of the Cold War, will be about 25% of the population.

Only the very oldest voters might be old enough to remember 1920, the high water mark for American socialism, before the Cold War or the Soviet Union, when Eugene Debs, running outside the major party system, got 3.4% of the US presidential vote as a socialist.",2019,03,04,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/socialism-republicans-democrats-2020-voters/index.html
deadline,Stephen Colbert Pans Donald Trump’s Historic Flag Dry-Hump Speech At CPAC,"Returning to Late Night after a break, Stephen Colbert said his week had been “great because I’m not Donald Trump.”

“The news cycle rode him hard and put him away wet,” the CBS late-night host joked of the week that included Trump’s failed Hanoi summit with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un and his former fixer’s televised testimony before the House Oversight Committee.

Colbert admitted he had “unplugged” from the news cycle while on his break but, a couple days before returning, started taking “little sips of the poison so it does not kill you on Day 1 back.”

First indication that the Orange Man was feeling blue, Colbert recalled, was Saturday’s historically long and epically weird speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference – “or D-BAG” – after “dry humping Old Glory.” Historically, it marked the “first time a flag has ever volunteered to be burned,” Colbert explained.

The speech also marked the longest presidential oration in American history, he added, revealing Trump spoke off script for 2 hours and 2 minutes.

Among Trump’s comments, he told CPAC attendees and TV viewers that Democrats “try to take you out with bullsh*t, bullsh*t.”

“Very presidential” Colbert said. “I’m reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s famous declaration: ‘Hey Robert E Lee – f*ck you.”",2019,03,05,https://deadline.com/2019/03/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-cpac-speech-flag-dry-hump-video-1202569542/

vanityfair,Trump’s Alleged Meddling with CNN Could Be an Impeachable Offense,"Presidents don’t typically get involved in anti-trust matters before the Justice Department. But according to a new report, that’s precisely what Donald Trump did, in an apparent effort to hurt CNN and boost his Fox News buddies. Per The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer, Trump in 2017 directed then-chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and then-chief of staff John Kelly to “pressure” the Justice Department to block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner, the entertainment conglomerate that owned CNN. “I’ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened!” Trump told Kelly in a meeting at the time with Cohn, according to Mayer. “I’ve mentioned it 50 times. And nothing’s happened. . . . I want that deal blocked.”

Mayer’s reporting would appear to confirm suspicions inside CNN and AT&T at the time. In late November, the D.O.J. sued to block the $85 billion merger, which executives at both companies saw as an essential step toward competing with Netflix and other ascendant streaming platforms. As my colleague Joe Pompeo wrote, sources at both companies believed the lawsuit was not driven by anti-trust concerns, but by politics. CNN remains a great source of frustration for the president, who frequently calls the cable network “fake news.” The speculation was that Trump was using his influence over the D.O.J. to force AT&T to divest itself of CNN. But AT&T C.E.O. Randall Stephenson was insistent that CNN be part of the deal, and the two sides went to court.

Cohn apparently agreed that Trump’s interest in the merger was inappropriate. “Don’t you fucking dare call the Justice Department,” Cohn reportedly told Kelly after the meeting at which Trump demanded a lawsuit. “We are not going to do business that way.” (The Trump administration insists that there was nothing political about the case, which it lost, appealed, and then lost again.)

Mayer documents the lengths to which the president has gone to intervene in the ratings war between CNN and Fox News, whose C.E.O., billionaire Rupert Murdoch, unsuccessfully attempted to acquire Time Warner in 2014. She also describes various instances in which Fox News actively sought to boost Trump. In one instance, the late Roger Ailes allegedly tipped Trump to questions he’d be asked at a Republican debate. Another time, the conservative-friendly cable network reportedly spiked a Fox journalist’s early coverage of candidate Trump’s alleged affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. (Trump, who paid tens of thousands of dollars to keep Daniels quiet, claims there was no sexual relationship.) The reporter, Diana Falzone, had “obtained proof” about the affair and confirmed it with multiple sources, but her editors didn’t want to run it. Former Fox executive Ken LaCorte reportedly told Falzone, “Good reporting, kiddo. But Rupert wants Donald Trump to win. So just let it go.” (LaCorte denies this account.)

The symbiotic relationship between Trump and Fox News, while unseemly, is well-known and largely public. Trump regularly calls into Fox News programs, offers programming advice, maintains close personal relationships with Fox hosts, and has stocked his administration with Fox News alumni. His alleged interference in the AT&T-Time Warner merger, however, may constitute an abuse of power. “If proven, such an attempt to use presidential authority to seek retribution for the exercise of First Amendment rights would unquestionably be grounds for impeachment,” tweeted Trump critic George Conway, a conservative attorney who is married to Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. Impeachment is surely a ways off. At the very least, the president’s interest in the merger is another tantalizing investigatory target for Democrats in the House. They’re already investigating just about everything else.",0,0,0,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/trumps-alleged-meddling-with-cnn-could-be-an-impeachable-offense

On his Monday FNC primetime program, Carlson said:

We’ve seen an awful lot of change during the two years Trump has been president. American politics has been completely reordered. But also the American media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal just five years ago are now extinct. Some of them are totally forgotten. Those that remain have either degraded themselves beyond recognition––like the New Yorker––or they’ve been purchased like Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for Amazon.com, like the Washington Post. It’s hard to remember that not so long ago, America had prestige media outlets.

nytimes,Opinion | Trump’s TV Trial,"Then came the House Judiciary Committee hearings on impeachment in 1974. Its final deliberations weren’t a trial, but according to the Langs, viewers experienced them that way, so that public debate came to revolve around the question of Nixon’s guilt or innocence. On Aug. 5, definitive proof of his guilt emerged: the “smoking gun” recording of Nixon agreeing to a plan to have the C.I.A. ask the F.B.I. to stop investigating Watergate. After that, wrote the Langs, “the inexorable logic of the facts” led to the president’s downfall.

We are about to find out whether facts still have an inexorable logic. The outlines of Donald Trump’s venality and fundamental civic disloyalty have been obvious since the 2016 campaign; Hillary Clinton warned us about him just as McGovern had warned about Nixon. But so far, neither Democrats nor prosecutors have woven the various threads of presidential wrongdoing into a coherent picture, showing how Trump’s shady business practices, opaque finances, vulnerability to blackmail, abuses of power and subservience to foreign autocrats all intersect.

Now, however, Democrats have begun a full-spectrum public investigation of the president. Michael Cohen’s blockbuster testimony before the House Oversight Committee last week was just an opener.

On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee took the first steps in an inquiry into obstruction of justice, public corruption and abuses of power by the Trump administration. In an operatic legal fusillade, it sent document requests to 81 people and entities, including Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, the National Rifle Association and Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. They have two weeks to respond. (Ivanka Trump is not on the list, but the requests that went out call for numerous documents about her, and the committee has said that more requests could be forthcoming.)

“To me it’s a thrilling moment,” Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told me. Finally, he said, “we have an opportunity to discover what has been happening in our country over the last two years and several months.”",2019,03,04,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/opinion/trump-investigation.html
foreignpolicy,The Tragedy of Trump’s Foreign Policy,"The Tragedy of Trump’s Foreign Policy

In a classic tragedy, the leading figure is usually a person with admirable qualities and even good intentions, drawn inexorably toward disaster by a tragic flaw. Othello is susceptible to jealousy, Macbeth is too ambitious, Hamlet cannot make up his mind, and Faust cannot resist an offer to trade his soul for knowledge and pleasure. In each case, a single flaw overwhelms their positive qualities and places them on the road to destruction.

From that perspective, it’s hard to see Donald Trump as a truly tragic figure. Far from being heroic but flawed, he’s just the spoiled, self-indulgent scion of a wealthy and odious father, with more deficiencies of character than one can count. Apart from a genuine gift for self-promotion, a decent golf game, and a practiced ability to connive on cue, he’s decidedly lacking in other virtues.

Yet there is an undeniably tragic quality to the Trump presidency, even if he manages to avoid impeachment, jail, or permanent disgrace. Why? Because Trump did have some valid and important insights into America’s current problems and he had a chance to do something about them when he got elected. That opportunity has been wasted, however, and Trump’s flaws as a politician, strategist, and human being are the main reason why.

What did Trump get right? In 2016, when he called U.S. foreign policy a “complete and total disaster” and blamed repeated foreign-policy failures on an out-of-touch and unaccountable elite, he was on to something. He was correct to accuse key U.S. allies of spending too little on defense—a complaint many previous presidents had made—and right on the money in denouncing open-ended and costly efforts at nation building in places like Afghanistan. Trump and Bernie Sanders were the only candidates to acknowledge that globalization was not delivering as promised, and his message resonated with lower- and middle-class Americans who were deeply worried about lost jobs, flat income growth, and lax immigration controls. Trump also recognized China as America’s principal long-term competitor and that Beijing would not stop its predatory trade practices if the United States just asked nicely. And Trump was nearly alone in recognizing that demonizing Russia was counterproductive and served only to drive Moscow closer to Beijing.

Moreover, Trump’s expressed views on international affairs suggested he had a more or less realist perspective on foreign policy that might have served him well—if he had really meant it and grasped its implications. Although he was hardly a sophisticated or knowledgeable thinker on such matters, he seemed to understand that 1) international politics were inherently competitive; 2) foreign policy was not about philanthropy; 3) all nations pursue their selfish interests; and 4) foreign adventures whose costs exceed the benefits are dumb.

After his surprising electoral victory, therefore, Trump was in a position to chart a more realistic course for the country, based on some—but not all—of the positions he had taken during the campaign. Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, and much of the public would have been receptive to a foreign policy that corrected the excesses and mistakes of the past quarter-century. Had he assembled an experienced team and insisted that it follow his vision, he might have improved America’s global position and won over many of his early critics. But as in a classic tragedy, Trump’s vanity, stubbornness, poor taste in advisors, and other deficiencies of character have led to repeated disappointments at home and abroad.

Let me count the ways.

With regard to Europe, Trump was correct in saying that Europe should get serious about its own defense and to stop relying on U.S. protection. Europe is wealthier, more populous, and spends a lot more on defense than Russia does, and there is no compelling reason for the United States to commit its own people to its defense. Accordingly, Trump could have proposed a gradual reduction in the U.S. commitment—say, over a period of 5-10 years—while making it clear that the United States wanted friendly relations with Europe and would continue to cooperate on areas of mutual interest. Indeed, Trump might even have tried to recruit Europe into a broader effort to check a rising China.

But that’s not what he has done. Instead, Trump has repeatedly insulted European leaders and embraced some of Europe’s most destructive political forces. He also increased the U.S. defense budget and the U.S. contribution to reassurance efforts in Eastern Europe, thereby giving NATO’s European members additional reason to free-ride some more. To be sure, some NATO members have maintained their Barack Obama-era commitments to increase defense spending but not by enough to lessen their dependence on Washington. With respect to NATO, in short, Trump has managed to weaken ties with key allies without reducing U.S. burdens.

In Asia, Trump understood that China was America’s primary long-term rival and it was time to get tough with Beijing about its economic practices. Unfortunately, he’s pursued that goal in a singularly inept way. He started off by unilaterally abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade deal that would benefited the U.S. economy in several ways and strengthened its strategic position in Asia. Instead of lining up other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in a united front over China’s trade and investment policy, Trump threatened to launch trade wars with several of them simultaneously. And in recent weeks, Trump’s all-too-public eagerness for a deal with Beijing has undercut his own negotiating team, making meaningful progress on these issues less likely.

Trump is also singlehandedly responsible for the bungled U.S. approach to North Korea. To be sure, North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is a problem that would challenge the shrewdest strategist, but Trump’s handling of it has been a textbook case of wishful thinking and the antithesis of hardheaded realism. Experts inside and outside the U.S. government insisted that Pyongyang was not going to give up its hard-won nuclear weapons capability, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the regime see as the ultimate guarantee of their own survival. Yet Trump deluded himself into thinking that his personal charm and self-proclaimed skills as a “master dealmaker” would somehow persuade Kim to do something that was obviously not in his own interest. Not only did Trump miss an opportunity to make tangible if limited progress on this vexing issue, but his bumbling gave America’s Asian partners yet another reason to question his judgment and competence.

In the Middle East, Trump’s policies have been a far cry from what realism would recommend. Instead of maximizing U.S. influence and leverage by establishing pragmatic working relationships with as many states as possible (as China and Russia do), Trump let himself get bamboozled by local potentates and repeated the same mistakes that have crippled U.S. Middle East policy for a long time. Instead of sticking to the nuclear deal with Iran and working with the P5+1 and other states to curtail Iran’s regional activities, he walked away from the deal and got nothing in return. He handed the Israeli-Palestinian peace process over to his unqualified son-in-law and turned a blind eye to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s increasingly erratic behavior.

Even when his instincts are correct—as when he announced he was going to pull U.S. troops out of Syria—he’s been a Hamlet-like portrait of indecision, and his off-the-cuff remarks about using bases in Iraq to keep an eye on Iran roiled U.S. relations with Baghdad to no good purpose. And having promised to get out of the nation-building business, he sent more troops to Afghanistan (like Obama did), where they are likely to still be fighting when he leaves office.

Then there’s Russia. Back in 2016, Trump recognized that ironing out America’s current differences with Russia would be good for Europe, good for Russia, and good for the United States, too. But instead of confronting Russia over its misdeeds—including its possible interference in U.S. elections—and beginning a serious dialogue to resolve issues like Ukraine, cyberattacks, and arms control, Trump’s conduct as president has reinforced doubts about his own relations with Moscow (and Russian President Vladimir Putin). Ironically, he is just about the last person who could even try to work things out with Russia because any serious effort to do so would lead critics to accuse him of being under Putin’s sway.

Finally, if the essence of realism is to deal with the world “as it really is” (rather than how we would like it to be), then Trump is more of a fabulist. A true realist would acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change and try to develop an effective policy response to it. Indeed, given his own background and prior statements, and the growing deference of the Republican Party itself, Trump was well-positioned to realign the party with the scientific consensus. Instead of continuing to deny the reality of climate change, he could have reversed course, said he now understood it was a serious problem, and called for something better than the Paris climate accord. If it took a Richard Nixon to go to China, maybe Trump could have restored environmental sanity to the Republicans.

It really is a tragedy. Not unlike Obama (whose popularity and dignity Trump clearly envies), Trump entered the Oval Office hoping to liquidate some of America’s counterproductive overseas commitments, pass the buck to local allies in Europe and the Middle East, focus laserlike on China, and do some much-needed nation building at home. Remember when he used to talk about a big infrastructure program, something that would provide jobs for lots of workers and prepare the United States to compete more effectively in the rest of this century? Sadly, the only building he ever talks about now is a pointless wall that most of the country doesn’t want, isn’t going to make the country safer, and probably won’t get built. More than two years into his first term, Trump most visible foreign-policy “achievement” is a steady and sharp decline in America’s global image.

And that’s the real tragedy. For unless Trump is eventually brought down by his legal troubles, he’ll probably live out the rest of life in comfort, surrounded by a retinue of sycophants, supplicants, and other lowlifes of the sort he cultivated throughout his life. It’s the rest of us who will end up footing the bill for this train wreck of a presidency.",2019,03,05,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/05/the-tragedy-of-trumps-foreign-policy/
theatlantic,Will John Bolton Bring on Armageddon—Or Stave It Off?,"On the afternoon I met John Bolton, in October, he had just arrived in Tbilisi, Georgia, and wanted to spend a few minutes at leisure. Bolton has traveled widely, but this trip to Tbilisi was his first, so I volunteered to show him the city. Having no known interests or hobbies other than work has rendered Bolton horribly energetic and impatient, and I was warned that our tour would last no more than 15 minutes. Within seconds of being introduced, we were walking through the rain down Rustaveli Avenue, so fast that his security detail broke into a lope to keep up. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Bolton had come from Moscow. The purpose of the trip had been, among other things, to inform Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States planned to leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a landmark agreement between Washington and Moscow in their phased nuclear stand-down. Signed in 1987, its key provision committed the two countries to not point land-based nuclear weapons at each other, except from a great distance.

Not long ago, most observers of foreign policy would have pronounced Bolton’s career over, and predicted that he would not reenter government unless (in some kind of King Ralph scenario) literally dozens of other Republican operatives were suddenly and tragically unavailable. But a little more than a year after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Bolton vaulted over all his rivals. He is now the most important figure in American national security, and because his position requires no Senate confirmation, he answers to no one but Trump. With the departure of James Mattis as secretary of defense early this year, Bolton is, incredibly, the only senior security official close to Trump who has seen how a normal White House works. (He has served in every Republican administration since 1981. Most Trump appointees have never served any other president.) Bolton’s return to power has allowed him to pursue his great passions in life, which are outmaneuvering his adversaries, foreign and domestic, and getting America out of treaties. (“So many bad deals to kill,” Bolton once wrote, “so little time.”) Sloshing down the street in Tbilisi, he seemed to be experiencing his version of the human emotion known as happiness. Elsewhere, others were experiencing existential dread. Leaving an arrangement partially responsible for the lack of thermonuclear war is exactly the kind of move that many feared when Bolton was appointed last March. Days before Bolton’s Russia trip, Trump had announced, after a rally, that he would leave the treaty. Few doubted that Bolton had persuaded him to do so, and that it would fall to Bolton—widely seen as the most bellicose person appointed to high office in living memory—to hash out a new plan to avoid nuclear annihilation. He and Putin both have proud, mulish temperaments. Combine them with weapons of mass destruction, and Strangelovian scenarios begin to suggest themselves.

Today, in his unstylish glasses, collared shirt, and fuzzy sweater, he reminded me of Ned Flanders, Homer Simpson’s gratingly polite neighbor and an unlikely agent of Armageddon. Because we had just met, I tried to keep things light. Most of his colleagues from the George W. Bush administration had declined to serve Trump. Why hadn’t he?, I asked. Was he a traitor to his class—the lone neoconservative to cross the Never Trump line? Bolton eyed me for a moment, looking like he was trying to determine whether I was an imbecile. “There is a propensity of the media to put labels on people, and sometimes a propensity of people to accept those labels,” he said, choosing his words carefully. “Journalists often call me a neoconservative. That’s clearly not accurate.” He quoted Irving Kristol’s quip that a neocon is a liberal who has been mugged by reality. “I have never been mugged by reality. I was for Barry Goldwater when I was 15.” He looked amused by the idea that anyone might require conversion to come to his worldview. Read: The deeply underdeveloped worldview of John Bolton “I would describe myself as pro-American,” Bolton said. “The greatest hope for freedom for mankind in history is the United States, and therefore protecting American national interest is the single best strategy for the world.” He said that America has slowly constrained its range of action, through foolhardy entanglements with international institutions such as the United Nations, and naive bilateral agreements that promised too much to America’s enemies in exchange for too little. He saw bad deals all around: The INF Treaty, which even Barack Obama’s administration said Russia had violated with impunity, was one. The Iran nuclear agreement, which Bolton has labored tirelessly to scrap, was another. Related Stories John Bolton and the Normalization of Fringe Conservatism

How John Bolton Views U.S. Allies and Adversaries One thing liberals and neoconservatives share, Bolton suggested, is an irrational, “theological” attachment to principles—the principle that treaties and alliances are good (in the case of internationalist liberals) or that democracy must be spread at the expense of all else (in the case of neoconservatives). By contrast, he thought treaties and alliances needed unsentimental evaluation. One of the Russians on Putin’s team told him, “You strike me as a pragmatic diplomat.” “I said, ‘That’s the nicest thing anyone’s said about me for a long time.’ ” Bolton recalled, “Even in the Bush 43 administration, when we were most accused of unilateralism, I didn’t get up every morning thinking, What act of unilateralism can I accomplish today? I got up thinking, What interest of the United States are we going to advance today?” The 2016 candidate who most embodied this pragmatism, he said, was Donald Trump. “Pro-American,” Bolton ventured, is the real meaning of Trump’s “America first” line. Pay no attention to the fact that “America first” was the slogan of Nazi sympathizers during the 1930s, and that the present-day version evokes racism and xenophobia. He calls the historical echoes “obviously controversial” but argues that the substance of the slogan today is different. “I talked with the president during the transition and several times afterward,” he says. “I thought his views were in the mainstream of Republican national-security thinking. Remember John McCain’s slogan in 2008—‘Country first’? What country do you think he was talking about?”

Read: John Bolton’s pragmatic nationalism is misunderstood By now Bolton and I had marched most of the way down Tbilisi’s main boulevard, pelted by rain and, in his case, questions. I realized that I had failed as a tour guide, having managed to point out not a single sight in the city. Bolton gave no evidence of having noticed anything at all. We may as well have been on treadmills at the hotel gym. To cross the street, we descended into a narrow tunnel lined with stalls selling trinkets, cheap wine, and greasy pastries. “Look at these,” I said, gesturing at a rack of churchkhelas—tubular, lumpy confections made from grapes. They resemble (to borrow Clive James’s description of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s arms) brown condoms stuffed with walnuts. Bolton turned his head about 10 degrees toward the rack of curiosities. But he was undistractable, and his gait barely slowed. “Look,” he said, turning back to the question. “I don’t like bumper stickers. [They’re] a shorthand for people who don’t have any time or interest for understanding what matters.” I remembered that Bolton is a lawyer, and a very good one, capable of wringing a favorable interpretation out of his president’s slogan, despite its unfortunate—and, to my mind, not plausibly accidental—connotations. “If ‘America first’ means judging national-security decisions in the context of what best protects America, then that is my view.”

Finding such a view—one that is defensible, and distinct from the most obvious meaning of Trump’s words—is a core Bolton skill, an exercise in lawyerly pragmatism with disdain for higher principle. Many will worry that Bolton’s pragmatism leaves him unrestrained, and that the world will suffer for it. But having a shrewd, amoral calculator in charge might not be so terrible. After all, blind devotion to principles can lead to catastrophe, and freedom from principles at least leaves Bolton less prone to bold and irreversible gestures. With a president not only prone to bold gestures but incapable of any other kind, Bolton’s role as national security adviser is becoming one for which no one ever thought him suited: a moderating influence. Bolton is Trump’s third national security adviser. His appointment was delayed for two reasons, both anatomical. First was the issue of his mustache, a droopy soup-strainer that made Trump initially pass Bolton over because he did not think, according to Steve Bannon in Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, that “he looks the part.” (Trump instead chose Michael Flynn, who lasted only weeks, then H. R. McMaster, a clean-shaven three-star general, who served from February 2017 until Bolton took over last April.) The second impediment was more substantial, and had stalled Bolton’s ascent in previous administrations as well. “He is incredibly smart and capable,” a Bolton acquaintance told me. “He could have risen faster if he had just been less of a dick.”

It’s difficult to exaggerate how hard it is to earn a reputation as a dick in Washington. It’s like being known as a real nerd by fellow scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or as the resident prude by sisters at a nunnery. In Washington, boorishness can be a virtue, if the boor in question is on your side and gets things done. (Witness the admiration for Lyndon B. Johnson, who would sit on the toilet and summon aides to talk policy while smelling his fumes, and the contempt for the pious Jimmy Carter.) But Bolton is almost universally known for being off-putting and ill-tempered. “One of the world’s cheapest people,” says an ex-colleague. “An extremely unpleasant person,” says another. Because Bolton’s other signature quality is intelligence, former colleagues wonder how he abides his boss. In October, Trump called Bolton “Mike” at a press conference, perhaps confusing him with the golden-maned singer-songwriter Michael Bolton. (According to The New York Times, the mix-up is habitual.) At Trump’s Cabinet meetings, Bolton has been conspicuously absent from the chorus of rehearsed praise for Trump’s heroism and genius. But he also hasn’t spoken ill of Trump since he started working for him. Testifying against Bolton’s confirmation as United Nations ambassador in 2005, a fellow Bush appointee, Carl Ford, called Bolton a “kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy”—a terror to work for, but a groveler before power. Nevertheless Bolton knows a moron when he sees one. “John doesn’t suffer fools,” one acquaintance told me, speculating that his private meetings with Trump must be torture. “It warms my heart every time I think about it.”

Bolton at least sees the world in a way similar to Trump. McMaster did not. Trump chose him as a compromise candidate after Flynn resigned (having been caught lying to the FBI), only to discover that his new national security adviser’s loyalty was merely dutiful. McMaster harbored a fondness for international agreements and obligations; Trump and Bolton have no such affection. “McMaster is just defending the internationalist order America has been pursuing for decades,” a Bolton supporter told me. “Bolton has been fighting against the McMasters of the world for his whole adult life.” The job of the national security adviser is to coordinate the National Security Council, which delivers to the president the collective national-security advice of the Departments of Defense and State and the intelligence agencies. The post has expanded and contracted with the ambition and competence of its occupants and the presidents they serve. Henry Kissinger, national security adviser to Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, combined the offices of national security adviser and secretary of state, all but running his own shadow government. His successor, the Air Force lieutenant general Brent Scowcroft, worked to turn the office back into an advisory shop. But even Scowcroft acknowledged that the job had its privileges: After representing the opinions of all, the national security adviser can give his own opinion last. Bolton’s performance on Fox News melted the president’s heart. McMaster, Scowcroftian to a fault, drove his colleagues mad with consultation. “H.R. was trying to bring everyone on board,” one former NSC staffer told me. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first secretary of state, and Mattis, his defense secretary, bristled at being summoned by a second-string appointee, and one with only three stars to Mattis’s four. (“The idea that we had too many meetings is ridiculous,” the former staffer said. “It was maybe two meetings a week to discuss the entire world.”) Meanwhile, McMaster’s staff took on the Herculean task of translating the thoughts of Donald Trump into a “National Security Strategy”—a detailed, systematic text that could be used to advise Congress and guide policy for the whole executive branch. It was a hard-fought process. During this year of tedium, the president himself was engaged in a process of mustache habituation. Bolton became a Fox News regular. He was the smartest analyst on the channel. “If somebody says something dumb, John can take them, slice and dice, put some oil and vinegar on, and they’re done,” Danielle Pletka, an MSNBC contributor and a former colleague of Bolton’s at the American Enterprise Institute, told me. But Bolton also mastered another register, she noted—“on-camera combat in the ‘Jane, you ignorant slut’ sense.” Bolton had long expressed proto-Trumpian opinions, including a sense of identification with a silent American majority (“The great unlettered and unwashed,” he once wrote), and confidence that everyday patriots were rising up to reclaim their country. He acquired a Trumpian vernacular. For decades he had inveighed against bureaucrats (and privately called them “mattress mice,” for their tendency to infest the executive branch). Now he knew to call them “the deep state.”

Read: What Trump’s choice of Bolton reveals Fox News’s No. 1 fan grew used to seeing Bolton on television. “John played Trump perfectly,” says Mark Groombridge, who worked for Bolton in government and out for more than a decade. “Bolton auditioned for this position for essentially a year. And he nailed that audition.” (Groombridge, a Never Trump Republican, split with Bolton in 2016, and the two no longer speak.) Bolton’s supporters acknowledge that his performance on Fox News melted the president’s heart. “So many of the people who populate this administration watched Bolton teach the country, through Fox, how to think about foreign policy,” says Matt Schlapp, a friend of Bolton’s and the chair of the American Conservative Union. “That’s why you have people like [White House economic adviser] Larry Kudlow and John Bolton in serious positions. They know how to communicate to the president in a way that he’s used to.” The first year of the Trump administration had been lost to poor planning and lack of familiarity with government, otherwise known as rank incompetence. The president’s deputies were Clouseau-esque, and it is possible that their ineptitude saved the world from the implementation of disastrous policies. Then came Bolton. He has been called many things—vain, miserly, rage-prone—but never incompetent, and his arrival disrupted a delicate balance of idiocy. Bolton was born in 1948, the first child of a Baltimore firefighter and a housewife. Friends I spoke with expressed doubts that he ever had a childhood, although his 2007 memoir includes photographic evidence that he was once a 5-year-old. He attended the McDonogh School, a private academy outside Baltimore, as a scholarship kid. At Yale, he resented the “smug, self-satisfied” campus leftists who cut classes to protest the Vietnam War while he focused on his studies. He was already plotting revenge for his fellow conservatives. In 1970, he told the audience at his Yale commencement, “If we do not make our influence felt [on campus], rest assured we will in the real world.”

At Yale Law School, Bolton overlapped with Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham as well as Clarence Thomas. “He’s fundamentally a lawyer,” John Yoo, a Bolton colleague and co-author who served in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, told me: He approaches problems with an eye for process and detail. And, as many have observed, he’s very good at getting his way. A favorite tactic is a swarming attack, heaping arguments on his enemies until they are buried and overwhelmed. Upon leaving law school, Bolton joined Covington & Burling, one of Washington’s top firms. He served in the Reagan administration as general counsel to USAID and, briefly, as Attorney General Edwin Meese’s liaison to Congress. Bolton said these early years in government were his education. “Ever since I was at USAID, I studied how the bureaucracy works,” he told me. “Every department has a different culture. Working the interagency process successfully means knowing everything about all those cultures.” It means knowing who will produce a memo undermining your plan, what that memo will say, and how to make sure its author will fail. “You have to judge what you want, where the opposition to it is going to be, where the support for it will be. You mobilize the support and overcome the opposition,” he said. “That may sound straightforward. But the number of people who go into government and realize that is depressingly low.”

Missing from his vocabulary is any mention of collegiality, except to brag about its absence. He relishes his opponents’ frustration. “I don’t really care what they think about me,” he said. “I know the rules of the road. What’s really frustrating to people is that I actually follow the rules, and I still get things done.” One of his proudest moments in public service was when Senator Joe Biden, opposing Bolton’s confirmation for a job in George W. Bush’s State Department, said he was “too competent.” “I would rather you be stupid and not very effective,” Biden said. In 1989, in the George H. W. Bush administration, he became the State Department’s assistant secretary for international organizations—the equivalent, in retrospect, of making a pyromaniac the liaison to a pile of dry twigs. Bolton kept his Zippo holstered for most of those years, but he moved subtly to reform America’s relationship with the United Nations. He observed that the United States had separate policies for numerous UN agencies: one for working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, another for the UN Development Program, still another for UNICEF. He proposed a “unitary UN” policy, which would subsume all of these. The stated reason was streamlining. But in effect he would have downgraded the relationship, as surely as closing consulates would downgrade diplomacy with a foreign country. Bolton caught a lucky break in 2000. When the recount of Florida’s votes in the presidential election began, George W. Bush and Al Gore sent armies of lawyers to Florida. Bush’s team was led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who had mentored Bolton a decade earlier, in Bush’s father’s administration. Bolton had, by chance, spent years in private practice in the 1970s litigating Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court case that to this day is a controlling decision in federal election law. He was a ringer. In his memoir, Surrender Is Not an Option, he says he left for Florida in haste, but not before returning his uncooked Thanksgiving turkey to his neighborhood grocery store. (I told him I didn’t think groceries accepted returns of raw poultry. “I didn’t either,” he said, but surrender was not an option even at Safeway.)

Bolton was rewarded for his work on the recount with the office of undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. He hounded Iran and North Korea about their weapons programs and incurred invective from the latter, colorful even by the standards of Pyongyang. A foreign-ministry spokesman called Bolton “human scum” and said he lacked “an elementary faculty of thinking” and was a “bloodsucker,” “a beastly man bereft of reason.” Someone this talented at provoking conniptions in his enemies could not, in the Bush administration, be wasted in an obscure position for long. Within a year he was being considered as a possible deputy secretary. Yet Bolton’s belligerence is sometimes misunderstood. The Bush policy decision with which he is most closely associated is the one he was least involved in planning or executing: the invasion and occupation of Iraq. Five years earlier, when Bolton was at the American Enterprise Institute, he had signed letters to the White House and the Senate urging “a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts” to remove Saddam Hussein. Among the 17 others who signed the letters was the neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz, Bush’s first deputy defense secretary. As a signatory, Bolton has been considered a charter member of the committee to invade Iraq. “I expect that the American role [in post-invasion Iraq] actually will be fairly minimal,” he told the BBC in 2002.

Today he pleads innocence. “People say, ‘You were responsible for the Iraq policy under the George W. Bush administration!’ I was not,” he told me. He was, instead, sidelined by others in the administration. “[Secretary of State Colin] Powell basically cut me out of Iraq. That was probably the kindest thing he ever did for me.” It is typical of Bolton to recede into the background and let others own failures. But Bolton’s allies say it is also characteristic of him to have been wary of an occupation. “Wolfowitz wanted to go into Iraq to spread democratic values,” says a Bush-administration official involved in the war’s planning. “Not Bolton, not Cheney. It’s the difference between ‘Let’s go in there to make Iraq democratic’ and ‘Let’s go in there to kick the shit out of our enemies.’ ” Bolton never supported nation-building in Iraq, his ex-colleague Groombridge told me, although he was happy to bomb Baghdad to make America stronger and safer. “Saddam Hussein sucked,” another Bolton acquaintance told me with a shrug. “For Bolton, that was the end of the story. He cared that Saddam was an arms proliferator, but not that he cut out the tongues of his enemies.” Fifteen years later, Bolton and Trump would utter similar comments about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, now accused of ordering the assassination of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman might be a murderer (“Who knows?” Trump said), but America’s alliance with Saudi Arabia mattered more than a single dismembered body.

In 2005, Bush nominated Bolton to be UN ambassador. Bolton and Bush knew to brace for a confirmation fight, but the bitterness and spleen exceeded expectations, and the hearings became a spectacle. Bolton’s enemies portrayed him as a creep. Melody Townsel, a USAID contractor who’d had a legal tiff with one of Bolton’s clients, claimed that he’d stalked her around a hotel, screaming at her and making insinuations about her sexuality and her weight. Hustler magazine’s publisher, Larry Flynt, spread rumors about Bolton’s divorce. (Bolton, who denies Townsel’s accusations, has now been married to his second wife, a former official at the International Organization for Migration, for 33 years.) Bolton’s sense of humor, more mordant than funny, was quoted against him. In 1994, Bolton noted that the UN headquarters, in New York, has 38 stories. “If it lost 10,” Bolton said, “it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” The view that the UN is bloated and inefficient is shared by the institution’s defenders. Bolton’s sin was to phrase the thought aloud, and in language that suggested physical demolition. Senate Democrats blocked his confirmation, so Bush appointed him during a congressional recess. He served 17 months in the role. At the UN, he exuded contempt. In his memoir he says the General Assembly hall’s architecture is “vaguely fascist.” He scoffs at the tendency to treat Kofi Annan, the secretary general, as “a secular pope,” and he calls General Assembly President Jan Eliasson “President of the World.” Neither title is meant as a compliment. Nor is the nickname “EUroids,” which he uses to describe Europeans he considers pains in the ass.

I asked Bolton whether the U.S. should leave the UN, which seems both a logical conclusion of his contempt and a policy that Trump himself might consider. He replied by quoting Jeane Kirkpatrick, who served as Reagan’s UN ambassador: “No,” she said. “It’s not worth the trouble.” “Bolton is a sovereigntist,” John Yoo told me. “He thinks the U.S. should not be bound by international organizations, and we should not be ceding our authority to the United Nations or NAFTA.” After the Cold War, “the U.S. tied itself down with multilateral institutions, primarily run by Europeans, to constrain our freedom of action—to tie down Gulliver.” Every time the United States joins an alliance, or consents to arbitration on equal terms with, say, Latvia or Guinea, one more rope is lashed over Gulliver’s limbs. Liberal internationalists, who tend to support the United Nations and the International Criminal Court, disagree. “I stopped teaching Bolton’s articles, because his views were so absurd,” says Oona Hathaway, an international-law professor at Yale and a Pentagon official in the Obama administration. “Now I have to teach him again.” As a Bush official in the early 2000s, Bolton worked to torpedo the International Criminal Court, on the grounds that the U.S. should not cede its sovereignty. He achieved this goal by strong-arming more than 100 countries, one by one, into agreeing never to turn Americans over to the ICC—thus rendering the U.S. a nonparticipant in the court. Hathaway says the notion that a tiny bureaucracy in The Hague would rob the U.S. of its sovereignty is preposterous, even paranoid. America could have batted away an ICC prosecution. Many human-rights violators cannot, so on balance the court would make the U.S. more powerful and the world safer. “Global cooperation doesn’t undermine U.S. sovereignty,” she told me. “It strengthens it.”

But cooperation does mean constraint, and sometimes an international agreement will bind America to doing something it would prefer not to. “Normal human beings understand that sometimes you limit yourself—like in a marriage,” Hathaway said. “You agree to not go running the first time your spouse drives you crazy.” To Bolton those alliances are traps. “Ask the Brits what it means to get out of the European Union,” he said. Marriage can be hell. So can divorce. Bolton sees the UN, and fans of international law more generally, as a clutch of nattering spouses, trying to get Uncle Sam to modify his behavior. The international-law professoriat is a “dangerously underworked group of people,” he told an audience in 2011, who “are dissatisfied with the political outcome that they’ve achieved in our system, and who have determined to take their arguments into the broader international context” as a way to force America to do what voters have rejected. “Within the United States, we’re fully capable of deciding what our policies should be,” Bolton told me. “That includes environmental issues, the death penalty, gun control, abortion—all of which are hotly debated in America, and on all of which the majority position is different from the overwhelming majority in Europe.” Here his view on international law intersects with the Trumpian notion of a deep state: a corps of unelected monitors who obstruct the democratically chosen sovereign. Globalism and multilateralism, he said, constitute a way to appeal an electoral loss to “the government of the world.”

If the NSC under McMaster was a consultative body, under Bolton it has become the opposite. The “National Security Strategy,” the document that was the fruit of McMaster’s allegedly interminable meetings, is written and filed away, Bolton told me, and consulted by no one. “I don’t view writing strategy papers as big accomplishments,” he said. The measure of an NSC, he said, is what it does: exiting the Iran nuclear deal, exiting the INF Treaty, managing an end to the Syrian civil war, preparing countermeasures to cyberattacks. “The NSC is not a think tank.” The Iran deal, however, was finished long before Bolton arrived, and the Syrian civil war is neither over nor likely to be resolved favorably for America or its allies. One of the surprises of the Trump administration is Bolton’s failure to do more, in the dramatic fashion that his enemies always feared, and that his own self-proclaimed prowess at bureaucratic manipulation would presumably allow. Bolton worked in the background of the July 2018 Helsinki summit with Vladimir Putin, an otherwise unremarkable meeting remembered for Trump’s servility at the subsequent press conference. (Bolton, a Russia hawk who has described Putin as an enemy, repeats the administration’s claim that the president is tough on Russia.) He seems to have left North Korea to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But that is a tactical surrender. The North Koreans still consider Bolton “scum.” And Korea is the conflict that the United States is least likely to manage successfully. Groombridge, who worked on North Korea for Bolton at the State Department, said the current policy will probably entrench Kim Jong Un and “turn him into another Fidel Castro.”

Read: John Bolton’s radical views on North Korea “He’s going to make [North Korea talks] fail if he can,” another ex-Boltonite says. Bolton’s record with the North Koreans suggests that he would rather have Kim as an enemy than as the condo-developing, nuclear-armed friend Trump and Pompeo are trying to create. Bolton’s motives will also be professionally self-serving, says his ex-colleague: “Why should I break my pick fighting my boss over this? When it fails, I need someone to be the one associated with it instead of me.” Last year, Bolton compared Trump’s North Korea policy to the policy that led to the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi in 2011. Qaddafi ended up sodomized with a bayonet, then shot in the head. The comparison did not make Kim Jong Un more trusting of Trump’s overtures. If Bolton’s intention was sabotage, it may have worked. There are few wins for Bolton to claim unless you count averting catastrophic failure as a win. At that he has emerged as a quiet hero. And that possibility—that Bolton will shiv not only his enemies but also his friends—is one reason nearly everyone is nervous about Bolton’s rise. The person in whom power has been consolidated knows every trapdoor, booby trap, and strategically placed banana peel in the federal government. He says he models himself on Scowcroft. Others say he is more like Kissinger (“but without the sentimental streak”). The incessant consultation with top national-security officials has stopped. “People are saying how much they missed those calls and meetings,” a former NSC staffer told me. In previous roles, Bolton gave career bureaucrats meaningless tasks to keep them preoccupied. He worried about the risks of having idle, undirected staffers who would usurp politicians’ power and claim it for an unelected bureaucratic class. “Policy can be made in the absence of attention, and Bolton knows that,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Bolton ally, told me. Now Bolton is so powerful that he can just fire bureaucrats, or tell them to get lost.

Or—and here the shiv flashes from its scabbard—he can call the meetings, for the sole purpose of sinking rivals. “He knows which memos have been written, by whom, and when, and he doesn’t bring up an issue unless he knows how it’s going to land,” says a Bolton acquaintance. “I’m sure when these principals’ meetings take place, he is trying to game it to get Pompeo to say this or that,” accidentally owning the failures and giving away the wins. There are, however, conspicuously few wins to claim—unless you count averting catastrophic failure as a win. And at that Bolton has emerged as a quiet hero. Notice a familiar rhythm: Trump says something, Bolton says he agrees, then Bolton reinterprets Trump to mean the opposite of what he said and pushes to implement his reinterpretation, presumably with Trump’s blessing. Bolton sometimes sounds less like a national security adviser than a lawyer clawing back the utterances of an uncontrollable client. His defense of “America first” was one such maneuver, twisting a slogan of Lindberghian isolationism into the interventionist foreign policy of John McCain. Bolton told me, further, that he personally favors increased immigration into the United States, through legal means. A few months later, at his 2019 State of the Union address, Trump said the same: that he “want[s] people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever.” His administration had, up to then, made even legal immigration more onerous. (No policy change seems imminent.)

Another example is the American exit, or non-exit, from Syria. In December, Trump announced, “Our boys, our young women, our men—they’re all coming back, and they’re coming back now.” That action would concede Syria to Bashar al-Assad, and to Iran and Russia, and it would all but guarantee the defeat and possible slaughter of U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab forces. Mattis resigned in principled dudgeon, and wrote an open letter to Trump. Bolton moved more slyly. After a brief delay, he stressed the “consistent U.S. position on standing by the Kurds and those who fought with the U.S.” He added, “There is no change to the U.S. position against the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Any further use will be met by a swift, strong response.” If the U.S. position were consistent, Bolton would not have had to describe it as consistent. But he seems to have achieved the delay in withdrawal that Mattis did not. In January, when Trump himself tweeted a revision of his previous promise, Bolton tweeted, “My thoughts exactly.” He told me to expect “continued presence” in Syria and Iraq, as a bulwark against Iranian expansion and the resurrection of the Islamic State. Trump’s promise of all and now are at this point a fading memory. And then there is NATO. Again Bolton’s directness—and good sense—in past statements have proved awkward in dealing with current political realities. In July 2016, on a Breitbart News radio program, Bolton denounced then-nominee Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. not defend fellow NATO countries. (NATO is one international accord Bolton considers worthwhile.) He called Trump’s statement “very disturbing” and “a dagger at the heart of the most successful political-military alliance in human history.”

“What I said before I joined the government is out there,” Bolton told me. “That’s what I believe. My views haven’t changed.” In January, The New York Times suggested that Trump’s haven’t either: He has repeatedly asked advisers about the possibility of leaving NATO. Yet Bolton argues that Trump’s commitment to NATO is indistinguishable from his predecessor’s. “If you look at the direction of [Trump’s] remarks on NATO since he joined office and some of the things he’s said, it’s very hard to see distance between that and Barack Obama calling a lot of our NATO allies free riders” for failing to allocate enough of their budgets for defense. I said I doubted that European leaders would have shuddered with fear if Trump had just asked them to pay more, and not also implied that he would consent to their falling under Russia’s yoke. Bolton urged me to look at Trump’s “actual record and formal statements.” “What Trump said was ‘Are we a collective defense organization or are we not?’ Collective means collective,” Bolton said, pointing out that NATO members had started spending more on their militaries. “I view that, in real defense terms, as a major accomplishment.” Focusing on a 1 percent rise in defense spending, I argued, is a diversion from Trump’s apparent indecision about whether NATO should exist at all. Bolton may have been growing frustrated, but he remained polite. And in noting that he no longer publicly criticized the president on NATO, he came close to being apologetic. “Being a pundit is one thing, and being in government is another thing,” he said. “If I were president, I might say things one way. But I didn’t get elected.” Philip Montgomery Bolton turned 70 in November, and there are few higher offices to which he could aspire. During the early 2010s, he flirted with a presidential candidacy, eliciting smirks from Republicans who imagined him riding buses across New Hampshire and Iowa, earnestly listening to the opinions of snowplow drivers, farmwives, and, yes, international-law professors. Groombridge said the point of the presidential bid was more realistic: to raise his profile and make him a candidate for secretary of state. His last attempt at Senate confirmation had failed, humiliatingly. Now, however, a solid Republican majority, plus rule changes making that majority impervious to one or two defections (Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky says he’s an “automatic no” on Bolton), render confirmation possible, if Trump remains pleased with him.",0,0,0,https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/john-bolton-trump-national-security-adviser/583246/
vox,"The chaotic Trump-Kim summit aftermath, explained","The aftermath of President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s unsuccessful summit in Vietnam last week has been nothing short of startling.

On Saturday, the American and South Korean military defense heads agreed to end two major military exercises between their countries — all in an effort to reduce tensions with North Korea. Indeed, it’s likely to delight Kim, who has long railed against the military drills as preparation for a US-led invasion of North Korea.

The next day, the New York Times reported that Pyongyang hacked more than 100 targets, including some in the US, while Trump and Kim were meeting in Vietnam. It goes to show that even as the two leaders are working to build a rapport, North Korea’s hackers operate unchecked.

Also on Sunday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton went on numerous news programs to discuss the Vietnam summit. While he defended the outcome, he revealed — shockingly — that he and Trump disagree on a key question: whether the US made a massive concession to Kim by holding high-profile summits with him.

And that evening, the president surprisingly tweeted that his inability to cut a deal with the dictator had more to do with his former lawyer Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony than with his flawed diplomacy, calling the Democrat-led spectacle “a new low in American politics.”

Put together, these latest developments show that the Trump administration’s North Korea policy is in chaos. If you missed any of it, don’t worry. We’ve got you covered.

The US and South Korea suspend military exercises

Around 6 pm on Saturday, the US and South Korea made a shocking announcement.

“Following close coordination, both sides decided to conclude the KEY RESOLVE and FOAL EAGLE series of exercises,” read a joint statement by acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo. Instead, they agreed to maintain close ties “through newly designed Command Post exercises and revised field training programs.”

That’s huge. Those two military drills allow US and South Korean forces to train side by side and learn how to work together in case, well, there’s a need for them to work together — like during a war with North Korea. Without these drills, their ability to fight with one another to win that conflict shrinks.

The fact that they’ve been canceled must be music to Kim Jong Un’s ears. For years, North Korea has argued that these joint drills, which feature thousands of troops and high-tech equipment, are a threat to its security. After all, the better the two countries can fight alongside each other, the better they could overthrow the Kim regime.

It’s partly why North Korea has long wanted a so-called “freeze for freeze” deal where Pyongyang stops testing weapons while the US and South Korea stop participating in major exercises. The cancellation of the drills, adding to the fact that Kim hasn’t tested a nuclear bomb or missile since September and November 2017, respectively, means Kim has effectively secured that agreement.

Trump, for his, part, seems fine with it.

The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2019

On the one hand, signaling to North Korea that the US doesn’t pose a threat is potentially good and could build trust between Washington and Pyongyang down the line. On the other, Trump’s reasoning — that not doing the drills saves “hundreds of millions” — is a bit off, since one joint drill costs around $14 million.

Trump tweeted about it again on Monday afternoon, this time noting that the drills were canceled solely because he wanted them to be after he met with Kim met in Singapore last June.

The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK—FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those “games”, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2019

The question now is if the gambit will work, and some experts, like Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, are skeptical. He noted last week that the US canceled a major military exercise in 1994 for similar reasons, only to have North Korea still consider the remaining drills as provocative. It’s therefore possible that “over time, Pyongyang may well come to hate whatever comes next,” he added.

Which means that though the joint decision makes sense now, it could prove to be a big problem in the future.

North Korea hacked US targets while Trump and Kim met in Vietnam

Trump is focused on two main things when it comes to North Korea: making sure it gets rid of its nuclear weapons and, over time, improving Washington-Pyongyang relations. While Kim is focused on those issues too, he clearly has other objectives in mind.

According to the New York Times on Sunday, North Korea continued its campaign to hack US and European companies even as Kim sat alongside Trump during their Hanoi summit last week. It’s a brazen move that shows there’s still a long way to go to normalize any relations between the two countries, even outside of the nuclear issue.

“They are very, very, very active. It’s been nonstop,” Raj Samani, the security firm McAfee’s chief scientist, told the Times. “We’ve seen them hit in excess of 100 victims.”

As of now, it’s unclear exactly why North Korea did this, although there are some suspicions that it wants access to the intellectual property of the targeted US banks and energy companies, since many were located in Houston and New York City.

What is clear, though, is that North Korea has a highly sophisticated cyber program.

North Korea was behind the May 2017 WannaCry cyberattack that used ransomware — where hackers scramble a victim’s files and then demand money to unscramble them — to infect businesses, banks, hospitals, and schools in more than 150 countries. One of the biggest strikes occurred in Britain, where it caused havoc in the health care system and interfered with surgeries and emergency services.

Experts and analysts also believe the Kim regime was behind the $81 million cyber heist of the Bangladesh Central Bank in 2016 and the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 right before it released The Interview, a comedy about two Americans who assassinate Kim Jong Un.

Of course, North Korea was just continuing its cyber efforts, so it’s not wholly unexpected that this happened during the summit. But if Kim were serious about decreasing tensions between his country and the US, he could’ve asked for a brief pause while he dined with Trump. The fact that he didn’t could provide some insight into his real thinking as it relates to future US-North Korea relations.

Bolton and Trump differ on if summits are a concession to Kim

The Sunday news shows are one of the best chances for an administration to make its case about its initiative of the day. This past Sunday, it was National Security Adviser John Bolton’s turn to explain why Trump and Kim didn’t sign a deal when they met in Hanoi last week.

For analysts, it was must-watch TV. When Bolton went on the same shows last year, he almost tanked Trump’s diplomacy with North Korea by saying the administration wanted Kim to abandon its nuclear weapons program just like Libya did. North Korea’s leader bristled at that, since Libya’s dictator was toppled with Western support years after he relinquished his arsenal.

This time, Bolton likely managed to anger another world leader: Trump. It’s worth reading Bolton’s telling exchange with CBS’s Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan in full:

BRENNAN: But, in the meantime, as we say, they can still produce nuclear fuel. And as you saw after the President left Hanoi, Kim Jong-un stayed there. I mean he was walking around touring hot spots in Vietnam. He no longer looks like a pariah. Didn’t he gain from this? BOLTON: I don’t think that’s the President’s view at all. It-- it’s-- BRENNAN: He sat across from the President almost as if an equal. BOLTON: He-- he did that in Singapore. The President’s view is he gave nothing away. BRENNAN: But do you actually believe that? BOLTON: The President’s view is he gave nothing away. That’s-- that’s what matters, not my view. As I’ve said before, I guess I can’t get people to listen so I’ll try it one more time. I’m the national security advisor. I’m not the national security decision maker.

Let’s be clear about what happened here: When given the chance to defend Trump’s belief that he has made no concessions to Kim, Bolton demurred, waving away the issue by claiming that his belief wasn’t important. That, of course, is ludicrous, since he’s the president’s top national security aide.

It’s also shocking, as top officials typically back whatever the president does in public. In this case, Bolton didn’t trash Trump’s view, but he slyly noted that they don’t share it.

This episode highlights the stark divisions within the Trump administration about North Korea. Clearly, Trump thinks holding summits with Kim is a good thing, allowing him to gauge the despot and press him to make some kind of deal.

Bolton, however, has long argued that Pyongyang will never end its nuclear program and that the US should instead consider attacking the Kim regime. Palling around with the North Koreans last week, then, was surely not Bolton’s idea of a good time.

He was right to note that Trump ultimately decides what course the US should take, and Bolton works to ensure the president’s wishes are carried out. But if Trump starts to sour on talks with Kim, Bolton will be just a phone call away to offer him his own views.

Trump blames Democrats for no deal in Hanoi

It was widely expected that Trump and Kim would strike a deal in Vietnam that included the US lifting some sanctions in exchange for North Korea dismantling part of its nuclear program. That didn’t happen, and Trump has a theory why.

No, it’s not that North Korea is unlikely to ever get rid of its nuclear weapons. And no, it’s not that neither side did the requisite staff work to prepare an agreement ready for the leaders to sign. It’s actually something else, Trump said on Sunday: the Democrats.

For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the “walk.” Never done when a president is overseas. Shame! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2019

Trump’s argument, then, is that the congressional hearing with Michael Cohen that took place during the summit led Trump not to sign a deal with Kim. But we know that’s not true.

As the New York Times reported on Saturday, Trump made a big ask of Kim: If he shut down all his weapons programs — nuclear, chemical, and biological — then the US would remove all relevant sanctions from North Korea. Kim rejected that deal, and both leaders stopped the talks before a planned lunch and signing ceremony.

But pretend, for a moment, that Trump was telling the truth. What he would’ve just admitted is that he couldn’t focus on one of the biggest diplomatic moments of his presidency because of what was happening back home. That’s quite a shocking — and frankly damning — comment made by someone who claims to be the world’s best dealmaker.

Perhaps we should await Trump’s newest book: The Art of No Deal.",2019,03,04,https://www.vox.com/2019/3/4/18249882/trump-kim-summit-north-korea-bolton-cyber-cohen-military
theverge,"T-Mobile admits it spent $195,000 on Trump’s hotel while lobbying for Sprint merger","T-Mobile has admitted that after it began lobbying for a merger with Sprint, it started to book stays for top executives at President Donald Trump’s Washington hotel. Over ten months, T-Mobile spent a total of $195,000 at the Trump hotel, it detailed in a letter to Congress Democrats last month that was seen by The Washington Post.

Last April, T-Mobile announced it was merging with Sprint. But for the merger to go through, it still needs the Trump administration to give its approval, as well as the Federal Communications Commission. In January, The Washington Post found that just a day after the merger was announced, the carrier booked nine T-Mobile executives to stay at Trump’s hotel. While at the hotel, the executives wore bright magenta shirts with the company logo.

The flurry of booking activity was a sharp contrast to T-Mobile’s previous hotel reservation patterns. The company had only purchased stays at Trump’s hotel for two officials in the past, staying for only two nights. Since the merger, the carrier has booked the hotel for at least 52 nights.

The money went toward lodging, catering, and renting out meeting space and equipment

T-Mobile revealed the large sum it had spent in a February 21st letter answering questions posed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA). The lawmakers have accused Trump of using his position as president to line his pockets with lobbying money. T-Mobile says the money went toward booking the rooms, but also to catering and renting out meeting space with audio and visual equipment.

The spending is only 14 percent of T-Mobile’s total spending on DC-area hotels — half of which went to Hilton hotels. T-Mobile also said it didn’t think the stays would play any role in helping the US government decide whether to approve the merger or not.

T-Mobile did not immediately respond to comment. It told The Verge in a January statement: “The T-Mobile senior leadership team stays at a variety of hotels in DC and across the country — and they are chosen primarily based on proximity to the meetings being conducted.”",2019,03,05,https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251722/t-mobile-trump-hotel-washington-sprint-merger-lobbying
npr,Elderly Trump Critics Await Mueller's Report — Sometimes Until Their Last Breath,"Elderly Trump Critics Await Mueller's Report — Sometimes Until Their Last Breath

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images

Expectations among Democrats are sky-high as reports have emerged about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation coming to an end.

In fact, expectations are so intense among some elderly, ill critics of the president that they say they want to try to hang on to see how the story all turns out.

As a World War II veteran, Mitchell Tendler had been part of the forces that fought Nazism.

And he lived through many historical milestones of the 20th century: the Korean War, then Vietnam, Watergate and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

And, in recent years, he was watching the current presidency with something bordering on obsession. Then, on Dec. 29, at the age of 93, he began feeling pain in his legs.



""I got a call at 11 o'clock. My mom said, 'Well, Dad's not feeling well — he really can't stand.' "" recounted Tendler's son Walter, who lives in San Diego. ""Within a couple of hours they called 911 and got him into the ER because it wasn't getting any better.""



Mitchell Tendler began to fade. He had outlived two implantable defibrillators and was on his third. The devices had kept him alive but now posed a problem for the medical imaging he needed in the hospital. Doctors gave him some painkillers, and then he had a final thought.

""It just was quiet for a little while,"" Walter Tendler recounted, ""and then he just sits up in bed halfway and looks at me and he goes, 'S***, I'm not going to see the Mueller report, am I?' And that was really the last coherent thing that he said.""

For nearly two years, those who find fault with President Trump have been hanging onto hope that Mueller will produce evidence that will be damaging to the president. These expectations are so high that there are even those who in their last years are hoping to survive just long enough to see the conclusion.

Richard Armstrong is 94 years old, currently in hospice care in Plainsboro, N.J., and identifies with Tendler's words.

""I know exactly how he feels. I feel the same way. I've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,"" he told NPR.

Armstrong is an independent who has voted for Republicans at times, including Richard Nixon in the '70s. But now he's watching Mueller with anticipation.

""I was hoping to live to see the outcome of what I think it should be — justice. I'll be surprised and disappointed if it isn't,"" Armstrong said.

The story about the World War II vet's last words made its way by word of mouth to Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.



He tweeted it out without naming the family and was flooded by responses from Americans whose parents or grandparents had similar feelings about Mueller.

""When I saw that tweet about the Mueller report and the old man on his deathbed, I thought, Oh my gosh, that's the kind of thing that my mother would say,"" said Kristina Makansi, who lives in Tucson, Ariz. Her mother died in January at the age of 94. ""I think she really wanted to see that justice was done ... and that the investigation was allowed to proceed without any shenanigans and obstruction.""

The voices in this story are hardly the only ones eager to see Mueller as the person who will give them the answers. Many Democrats want Mueller's investigation to lead to follow-on action.

""When it comes to Democrats the expectations are sky-high and they're looking for this to initiate further action, both of a political nature and of a legal nature against Donald Trump,"" said Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""They'll be disappointed, I think, if either of those fall short.""

These stories show just how much communities across America are eagerly waiting news from the special counsel — and it's even more urgent for those Americans approaching the end of their lives.",2019,03,05,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/05/700175470/elderly-trump-critics-await-muellers-report-sometimes-until-their-last-breath
cnn,The 67 most stunning lines from Donald Trump's epic 2-hour CPAC speech,"(CNN) Fresh off an unsuccessful summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , President Donald Trump jetted back from Vietnam just in time to appear at the annual CPAC conference.

And appear he did! Egged on by the red-meat crowd, Trump went on and on (and on) -- rarely staying on script in a speech that amounted to a sort-of greatest hits double album.

I went through the whole damn transcript -- and it was a doozy. The lines you need to see are below.

1. [Trump comes out on stage, claps, and then bear-hugs an American flag]

And away we go!

2. ""What we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital 'E' -- it's never been done before.""

Donald Trump, grammar expert. Also, copy editor. Also also, history-maker.

3. ""I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didn't quite understand that. They didn't understand it.""

They likely didn't understand it because Trump, prior to running for president as a Republican, had expressed any number of views -- on abortion, same-sex marriage and lots else -- that suggested he was more closely aligned with Democrats than the GOP.

4. ""How many times did you hear, for months and months, 'There is no way to 270?' You know what that means, right? 'There is no way to 270.'""

The 2016 election ended 846 days ago.

5. ""So I think we're going to do even better in 2020. I think we're going to do numbers that people haven't seen for a long time.""

""Numbers.""

6. ""But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich. The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty.""

Ah, those rich -- and dusty -- days. Man, they were great. Tough on the allergies. But great.

7. ""You know I'm totally off-script, right?""

Oh, yes.

8. ""You know I'm totally off-script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off-script. True.""

It IS true. Voters seemed to believe that Trump's often rambling, hard-to-understand speeches were evidence that he was an authentic politician who refused to be stage-managed. And they liked the idea of a guy who just, well, says stuff.

9. ""And if we don't go off-script, our country is in big trouble, folks.""

So going off-script is the key to future successes ... [sharpens pencil, breaks out new sheet of paper, begins calculations]

10. ""When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric. Let's hurry up. 'Darling' -- 'Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling.'""

""When the wind stop blowing, that's the end of your electric."" -- The President of the United States. (Also, Trump is talking here about his sarcastic ""support"" for the ""Green New Deal."")

11. ""So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted.""

Trump has taken to citing 1888 in his speeches of late. This will stun you, but his reading of the historical facts misses a few things

12. ""I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use. Should I use it? I won't do it.""

Trump has even turned his infamous love for cursing into some sort of anti-elites mantra. Amazing.

13. ""If you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, 'Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails. Please, Russia, please.'""

HA HA HA ... oh wait, on the same day Trump ""jokingly"" asked the Russians to get Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, the Russians began a cybercampaign to get Hillary Clinton's deleted emails

14. ""So everybody is having a good time. I'm laughing, we're all having fun.""

""I really can't say I guess I laugh to keep from crying."" -- Q-Tip

15. ""I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they don't like tariffs. I'm not liking or not liking.""

Here's the President on tariffs: ""I'm not liking or not liking.""

16. ""So they don't have anything with Russia. There's no collusion.""

Here's a few numbers on the ongoing special counsel probe into Russian interference : 199 criminal charges have been brought against 37 people and entities, seven people have pleaded guilty while four have been sentenced to prison.

17. ""I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday.""

""Little Adam Schitt"" grimaces.

18. ""So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with. We're waiting for a report by people that weren't elected.""

A terrific window into how much Trump has made the special counsel's report about him. Remember that special counsel Robert Mueller was asked to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the possibility that members of Trump's team may have colluded with the Russians. Instead of worrying about what it means that a malicious foreign power sought to influence our election, Trump is entirely focused on what the report -- and its findings -- mean for him.

19. ""We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson. This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I'm not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater.""

Well if ""people say that,"" who am I to argue????

20. ""Those red hats -- and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. 'Make America Great Again' is what it says. Right? Right?""

Wait. So is the key the color of the hats or what they say on them? I NEED TO KNOW.

21. ""And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there. And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit. OK? With bullshit.""

I assume Trump is referring to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia probe. Or maybe former FBI Director James Comey for launching the probe. Or deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for forming a special counsel to look into it. Maybe all of the above. Either way: It's total bullshit!

22. ""Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the attorney general says, 'I'm going to recuse myself.'""

Mueller and Rosenstein never received votes because they are career Justice Department officials. Mueller was a registered Republican, while Rosenstein was a Trump appointee. So ...

23. ""You take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen. All killers.""

First, a fact check. No one on Mueller's team ran the Clinton Foundation . Jeannie Rhee was outside counsel to the foundation but never worked there on the payroll. Not sure which member of Mueller's teams ""has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen"" but I know at least one person who could challenge them for their title ... And, no, no one of Mueller's team is a convicted murderer or ""killer.""

24. ""I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, 'why isn't that mentioned?'""

Trump is referring to an episode in 2011 when Mueller left a Trump golf club because, according to Trump, of a dispute over dues. Mueller says there was no such dispute. And yet, it is mentioned. Regularly

25. ""He wanted the job as FBI Director.""

It is true that Trump interviewed Mueller to be FBI director -- a job he held for a decade under Presidents Bush and Obama -- on the day before Mueller was named special counsel . It is not clear if Mueller expressed a desire to be the FBI director in those conversations.

26. ""I have one of the great inventions in history. It's called TiVo. I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right?""

""I invented the piano key necktie. I invented it!"" -- Jacobim Mugatu

27. ""And I fire a bad cop. I fire a dirty cop.""

Trump is referring here to Comey, a career Justice Department official. Not to that cop in ""The Wire"" who was always taking money off of the street hustlers and keeping it form himself. ( I see you, Randy !)

28. ""So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this.""

He's not even halfway done.

29. ""Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love. We're all in love together.""

Trump is talking about why he is speaking for so long and so far off-script. It's because of love, obviously.

30. ""There's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk. You can talk your heart out. You really could. There's love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy.""

What do you say to a man who has already said everything?

31. ""We never had an empty seat.""

Trump is claiming there was never an empty seat at ANY rally he held in 2018. Which, uh, isn't accurate

32. ""And from the day we came down the escalator, I really don't believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium.""

33. ""They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds.""

Trump's claims that more people attended or watched his inauguration than any other in history has been repeatedly -- and clearly -- debunked . And yet, here we are.

34. ""Remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument. And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet.""

He's STILL making excuses for why the crowd at his inauguration didn't look bigger. The grass was wet! The fencing! The sun was in my eyes!

35. ""We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it. And I have to live -- I have to live with 'crowd size.' It's all a phony deal.""

This is actually a good illustration of how Trump's world works. From where he was giving his inaugural address, he saw lots and lots of people. Therefore, it must have been the most ever -- even if objective facts don't bear that out. Those objective facts, in his mind, are just part of the fake news media's attempts to smear him.

36. ""But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day.""

Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. That was 773 days ago. But ""just the other night"" he was looking at a picture of his inauguration crowd. Totally normal stuff here!

37. ""Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it. And you'll see the sun. You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right?""

In which the President of the United States reveals he has been closely studying pictures of his inauguration crowd in search of evidence that they had been taken very early in the morning and, therefore, missed the big crowds. Sure!

38. ""You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible.' They said it was incredible. They said that was so great.""

Who is this ""somebody""?

39. ""I didn't want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Don't get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I don't want to get it.""

Trump is making clear here that he is not happy that he helped get drilling in ANWR approved because Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) wanted it to happen and he didn't want her to get something she wanted. Because she doesn't vote with him enough. Totally fine!

40. ""By the way, you know I'm building the wall. We're finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It's in the thing.""

It is, indeed, in the thing.

41. ""We have people in Congress that hate our country.""

WOW WOW WOW.

42. ""We have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes. We have some senators. We have some congressmen.""

Yes, waiter, I'll have the word salad.

43. ""For one thing, they don't respect us. They think we're 'stupido.'""

What were the odds in Vegas that Trump would say ""stupido""? One in a million? Higher? Those oddsmakers were stupido.

44. ""He called me up. He said, 'You're a great President. You're doing a great job.'""

According to Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told him how great he was doing. I, uh, doubt this is true.

45. ""The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it.""

Donald Trump on forest fires.

46. ""He said, 'I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met.'""

So, the liberal governor of California called up Trump to tell him how great he is and how smart he is? Riiiiiiiiiight.

47. ""But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, 'General, how long before we get 100% of the caliphate?' He said, 'Sir, two years.' I said, 'I can't take it two years.'""

""I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me."" -- Donald Trump

48. ""I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, 'Man ...' They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn.""

Words fail.

49. ""I have pretty good vision. At least for my age, I have good vision. I guess for my age, I have great vision.""

From good to great in two sentences: The life of Donald Trump.

50. ""So we changed his name. Called him 'Mad Dog.' But it wasn't working too well. Mad Dog wasn't working too well.""

Contrary to this claim, Trump didn't invent the nickname ""Mad Dog"" for his former Defense Secretary James Mattis. Not even close

51. ""And I said, 'Bring the cameras. I'm going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing.'""

Trump was in Iraq to meet with generals. His first thought? Bring in the cameras. Let's make a movie.

52. ""I mean, you talk central casting. These guys -- you couldn't -- I mean, it's incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie.""

Trump reveals, on almost a daily basis, that he views being President as akin to serving as the executive producer for the world's greatest reality show.

53. ""The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't. That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people. You know the movie I'm talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie.""

54. ""Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left. Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back.""

This speech lasted TWO hours. TWO.

55. ""And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats.""

Back to this then? Wasn't that sort of a first-hour-of-the-speech sort of thing?

56. ""See, I don't have white hair. I don't have white hair.""

Um, true!

57. ""She's like -- she's like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad.""

Donald Trump on Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) . Perfectly normal! Nothing to see here folks!

58. ""We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas. These ideas are dangerous.""

If Trump said just these two sentences over and over and over again, he would probably get re-elected. Because this anti-PC rhetoric resonates with lots and lots of people who likely aren't obvious Trump supporters. Of course, as this speech proves, he will never just say these two sentences. Or any two sentences.

59. ""Mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border.""

I think this interview with a border patrol agent is where Trump got this idea. it's not at all clear if this was an isolated incident or a common practice.

60. ""Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it.""

Trump is referring here specifically to the situation at the border. But really, he views every issue (and his whole life) through this lens. Someone else is responsible for the problem. But he will fix it.

61. ""I did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals.""

So, Trump deserves credit for the 2018 election

62. ""One of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, 'Excuse me, he didn't run.'""

So Trump doesn't deserve blame for the 2018 election ! (Also: These two sentences were uttered by the President within 20 seconds of each other. Good times.)

63. ""Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic. It's Democrat. We have to do that.""

This is the dumbest thing ever. It is the ""Democratic"" Party. Republicans in the 1990s decided that they would start saying it was the ""Democrat"" Party because they didn't want people to think only one party was on the side of democratic ideals. Smart move, Republics!

64. ""I hate to say in the speech, the 'Democrat Party' because it doesn't sound good. But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't. They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it's much better. Much better.""

They don't need to change it! It's already called the Democratic Party! Republicans just have to stop saying ""Democrat"" Party. Come on people. We can do this!

65. ""We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back.""

The rally for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp was held in one hangar. Not two. And definitely not three. The MOST people who were there? Around 18,500

cnn,Trump's emergency makes it harder to build the wall,"Yuliya Panfil is a senior fellow and director of New America's Future of Property Rights program. Previously, she worked at Omidyar Network, USAID and as a journalist. The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) President Donald Trump can declare a national emergency, and the government can take land for the border wall. But Trump can't do both.

University of Texas property law professor Christopher Johns can see into the future. His final exam for last year's eminent domain and property law class included the following question:

President Trump has decided to build the Wall, but Congress refuses to fund or consent to his project. Frustrated, Trump decides to go it alone, and acquire land for the wall anyway. Can he do it?

The correct answer? No, the President cannot unilaterally take land without Congressional authorization.

""If my students said 'Yeah, the president has the power to do this,' I wouldn't have given them any points,"" Johns told me.

In the days since Donald Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border, he has been rebuffed by Congress and sued by 16 states. Politicians and litigators argue that Trump doesn't have the authority to divert funds for constructing a wall, but they miss a potent argument: Trump may not have the authority to seize the land to build his wall.

In order to build a wall, the government must use its eminent domain power to seize more than 1,000 miles of property along the border. That power to take private property for public use is bedrock to a functioning government: It allows us to build bridges and highways, establish public parks and run utility lines.

But, eminent domain power rests in the legislative branch . That means the President needs congressional authorization to take land. By going around Congress and declaring a national emergency, Trump just ensured that congressional authorization isn't coming any time soon. In doing so, he may have created a massive barrier -- so to speak -- to his ability to construct the wall. He needs land for the wall, and if he's not allowed to take the land, he's stuck.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, there aren't many court cases that involve a president trying to grab property by fiat. The most cited analogue is the Supreme Court's 1952 decision in Youngstown v. Sawyer . There, at the height of the Korean War, President Truman had attempted to use his executive powers to nationalize steel mills in the face of a labor strike. The Supreme Court said that even during a war the president cannot seize private property without legislative authorization.

JUST WATCHED Rand Paul to vote against Trump's national emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rand Paul to vote against Trump's national emergency 02:09

The court rebuffed Truman's attempt to use the Korean War as a justification, stating that ""even though 'theater of war' be an expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production. This is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its military authorities.""

So if this argument is such a slam dunk, why aren't we hearing more about it?

One reason may be that property is a highly specialized field of law, and there just aren't that many lawyers who can speak authoritatively on both emergency powers and eminent domain. Of 11 experts that Vox recently asked whether Trump can use emergency powers for the wall, only one -- George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin -- discussed the property rights angle in detail. I reached out to the other 10 experts: Most responded that while Somin's argument sounded right, they didn't know enough about property law to comment.

Another reason may be the counterargument that if we assume Trump has Congressional authorization to fund part of the wall (for example by reprogramming drug interdiction funds), and seizing land is necessary for building that wall, then by extension he's authorized to seize the land. But, it's far from clear whether that causal link holds water, and the question would likely be litigated.

Two things, however, are certain.

The first is that Trump's border wall is making strange bedfellows of human rights-loving liberals and property rights-loving conservatives. Private property rights are a bedrock of conservative politics, and many Republicans are in the squirmy position of choosing between this first principle and Trump's campaign promise. Several Republican members of Congress to come out against the wall, Will Hurd and Justin Amash among them, have done so on property rights grounds.

And the second: If Trump makes a unilateral land grab, landowners will tie him up in court for years. In fact, that is the most likely outcome of the wall saga. Without congressional authorization, Trump can't move quickly to build his wall. Instead, he'll get stuck in court until 2020, and then who knows what will happen?",2019,03,04,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/opinions/trump-national-emergency-eminent-domain-panfil/index.html

politifact,Fact-checking Donald Trump's two-hour speech at CPAC,"President Donald Trump spoke to an enthusiastic audience at the Conservative Political Action Committee conference in Washington over the weekend. During his 2-hour-plus speech, Trump revisited many points from his political rallies.

He stayed on relatively firm ground when talking about the economy. But on immigration, abortion and the Democrats’ Green New Deal, he took liberties with the facts.

We checked the accuracy of some of his key claims.

""Visa lottery — that’s where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ‘Oh, here’s a wonderful person. Wonderful.’ You know, he killed four people. ‘Here’s — here’s another wonderful.’ … They send us the people they don’t want.""

This is inaccurate and a mischaracterization of the visa lottery program. The visa lottery isn’t a tool for foreign governments to ""send"" criminals or people they don’t want.

Winning the visa lottery doesn’t guarantee entrance to the United States. Lottery winners must pass background checks before they arrive in the United States. To apply for the lottery, individuals must also satisfy employment or education requirements. The computerized lottery system is administered by the U.S. State Department, not foreign governments.

""For many, many decades they’d been trying to get VA Choice. You couldn’t get it. ... Now these great veterans, if there’s a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills. They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved.""

This is false in several ways.

The Veterans Choice program started in 2014, so it wasn’t something that people had tried and failed to create for four decades. Choice wasn’t cheaper. The private companies hired to run the program pocketed 24 percent of program expenses — double the overhead in the private insurance industry. The VA ""was taken advantage of,"" Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie told House and Senate lawmakers. In 2018, Congress passed the Mission Act, which made the Veterans Choice program permanent.

— Jon Greenberg

Said Virginia’s Democratic governor said he would allow parents, ""if they didn’t want the child, who is now outside of the womb — long outside of the womb — they will execute the baby after birth.""

This is False.

Trump has said this before, most prominently in his 2019 State of the Union address. In reality, Virginia governor Ralph Northam was talking in an interview about the birth of a baby with such severe difficulties that it will not be able to survive for long.

Trump has used the term ""execution"" for this scenario before, but it’s inaccurate. Merriam-Webster’s definition of ""execution"" is ""a putting to death, especially as a legal penalty.""

No lawmaker supports actively killing newborns, much less ""executing"" them; the terrain that’s contested between supporters and opponents of abortion concerns what efforts should be made to extend the lives of babies who are not expected to survive long due to being born with severe disabilities.

In any case, Northam, a physician, never said he would sanction the execution of newborns.

— Jon Greenberg and Louis Jacobson

""We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.""

Trump has made this claim countless times, but it remains False.

In inflation-adjusted dollars, the recent tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh.

— Louis Jacobson

The ""Green New Deal"" proposed by some Democrats ""would end air travel.""

We rated a similar claim False.

The official Green New Deal resolution that Congress may vote on addresses ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution would be nonbinding.

The resolution makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail.""

Trump was presumably seizing on a messaging document from the office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that lightheartedly mentioned getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes"" and a desire to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" But her office has since disowned that document, and in any case, it’s not part of the legislation that would be voted on.

— Louis Jacobson

""Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission.""

This is out of context.

Mueller’s team does have 13 registered Democrats and no registered Republicans, and several team members made donations to Clinton’s campaign in various amounts.

However, Trump leaves out a crucial registered Republican — Mueller himself — and glosses over the fact that we don’t know the identities, or the partisan affiliation, of other Justice Department or FBI staff who are working with the investigation.

It’s also dubious to say that Mueller’s legal staff are among the ""angriest Democrats"" in the nation’s history. The investigation and its staff have rarely spoken publicly at all.

Finally, it’s important to note that Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team.

— Louis Jacobson

Medicare for All ""would lead to colossal tax increases — increases like you’ve never seen before — and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans.""

This presents half the picture.

The latest Medicare for All legislation would cover all medical services with essentially no out-of-pocket costs or premium charges. It would go beyond doctor and hospital services and include dental, vision, hearing, prescription drugs and long-term care. Ultimately, Medicare for All would replace private insurance. The plan for how to pay for it remains in flux, but there’s no question that taxes would need to rise substantially to finance it.

But Trump leaves out the other side of the equation — the savings that would come from not paying premiums and other costs. The net outcome would vary from group to group, with people who make less more likely to do better than higher income households.

— Jon Greenberg

In the last two years ICE officers ""arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder... Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders.""

These numbers are inflated. While the total number of arrests is accurate, the connection to crimes is exaggerated.

First, it includes double counting, because a single person could have committed multiple crimes. ICE itself notes that each arrest ""may represent multiple criminal charges and convictions."" The Pew Research Center found in February 2018 that ""The total number of charges and convictions is greater than the total number of arrestees.""

In addition, by folding together charges and convictions, the numbers look bigger, but a charge doesn’t mean that a person is guilty. Plus, ICE also notes that past convictions get included in each year’s tally. So for recidivists, the convictions pile up.

— Jon Greenberg

""One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north.""

This is partially accurate. It reflects findings of a 2017 Doctors Without Borders report, but it’s not necessarily representative of the entire migrant population trekking north.

Doctors Without Borders said 31.4 percent of women had been sexually abused during their transit through Mexico. That was based on a 2015 survey of more than 400 migrants interviewed in facilities where migrants seek assistance. (The majority of migrants interviewed were men.)

Doctors Without Borders said its report only provided a snapshot in time of the perils migrants face, and of a population accessible to the medical group. Doctors Without Borders has pushed back against Trump and his administration’s use of the data. The group says the administration is distorting and mischaracterizing the data, and selectively using it ""to scare Americans about violence at the border and to make a ‘humanitarian’ case"" for a border wall.

— Miriam Valverde

""Nobody shows up (for immigration hearings). Three percent of the people come back for a trial.""

This is an exaggeration. We’ve found that most immigrants do show up for immigration court proceedings.

Immigration courts fall within the Department of Justice. An immigration judge may hold a hearing even if an immigrant doesn’t show up.

In fiscal year 2017, about 70 percent of all immigration cases (149,436) were decided with an immigrant present. More narrowly, looking only at asylum cases (43,013), about 90 percent of immigrants showed up. Overall, about 59 percent of immigrants who were released (27,376) came back for their immigration case hearing.

— Miriam Valverde

""When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric (power). … ‘Darling, is the wind blowing today? I’d like to watch television, darling.’""

Ensuring uninterrupted electricity when using renewable energy is a legitimate concern, but it’s a manageable one. Today, utilities typically use a mix of fuels to generate energy, including some, like natural gas, that aren’t susceptible to running out if the winds are low or if clouds block the sun.

Already, some utilities use some of the surplus electricity they generate to pump water uphill, where it can be released downhill to generate electricity as needed. Going forward, researchers are working on additional methods, such as next-generation batteries, to store energy so it can be kept in reserve for slack periods for wind or solar generation.

— Louis Jacobson

We have created ""5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs.""

Trump is embellishing here.

The number of jobs nationally has grown by 4.88 million since he was sworn in in January 2017. To get to 5.3 million requires counting from the time Trump was elected in November 2016. However, that includes more than two months under President Barack Obama.

Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs are up, but Trump is exaggerating even more in this case. There were 454,000 more manufacturing jobs in January 2019 than there were when Trump was sworn in in January 2017. It also falls well short even if you start counting at his election -- the number since November 2016 is 481,000. Both figures are well below 600,000.

It’s also worth noting that the rates of job growth under Trump are not dramatically faster than they have been since early 2010, when the recovery from the Great Recession gathered steam.

— Louis Jacobson

""We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps.""

Trump is close on this one.

Since he was inaugurated, 4.46 million fewer Americans are receiving food stamps.

It’s worth noting, however, that food stamp usage peaked in late 2012 -- more than four years before Trump took office -- and has been declining ever since.

— Louis Jacobson

""The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years. And African American, … Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows.""

On Trump’s watch, all three of these numbers did hit record lows for the period since statistics have been kept, but in each case, the rate has gone up modestly since then. So Trump’s talking point, which uses the present tense, is no longer accurate.

African American unemployment hit a record low of 5.9 percent in May 2018, but it rose to 6.8 percent in January 2019.

Hispanic unemployment hit a record low of 4.4 percent twice — in October and December 2018 — but it rose to 4.9 percent in January 2019.

And Asian unemployment hit a record low of 2 percent in May 2018 but rose to 3.2 percent in January 2019.

— Louis Jacobson

""More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country.""

This is correct, but meaningless.

Outside of recessions, the total employment level typically goes up every month due to new individuals entering the workforce.

cnn,SE Cupp: How I felt watching Trump hug our flag,"SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of "" SE Cupp Unfiltered ."" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) It would have been a jarring image no matter the president.

We're used to seeing the American flag handled in a number of ways. It can be hoisted, saluted, folded in honor of the fallen, even burned in protest.

But it's not every day you see the leader of the free world hug the flag in front of a crowd of adoring followers.

Enter President Donald Trump on Saturday at the annual gathering of conservatives known as the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He grabbed an unassuming Old Glory by its stand like a prom date, and gave it a brief, slightly terrifying, slow-dance to ""Proud to be an American.""

In that moment, in a way, the flag was so many of us -- Americans recoiling at the smothering and unwanted advances of an unstable lech. On behalf of the flag, I wanted to shout: ""I beg your pardon, sir! Get your hands off of me!""

But as off-putting as Trump's grabbing of the stars and stripes felt to many, it was clearly a consensual act to his supporters, who loved every minute of it and the 122 that followed.

President Donald Trump hugs American flag at the CPAC annual meeting, March 2, 2019.

The rambling, unedited and lurching two-plus-hour performance at CPAC was more a series of disconnected blurts than a speech. From musing on the history of tariff policy in the US to praising Rep. Mark Meadows' wife to extolling the benefits of TiVo, Trump did what he arguably does best: He put on a show for a crowd that worships him.

JUST WATCHED Trump: They try to take you out with BS Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: They try to take you out with BS 01:55

He whacked all their favorite enemies: the press, Democrats, the Mueller investigation, Republicans who would go against him. Many conference attendees called it one of his best performances.

But Trump's ""best"" performances are almost always at the nation's expense. They are ""best"" because they are memorably divisive, unfiltered, often profane and seething with animus for enemies perceived and real. And they are all about love for him.

Manhandling the American flag was a perfect representation of this dichotomy. Half the country likely saw it as a fitting metaphor for his presidency writ large: an assault on our most cherished values. He took what was not his, robbed it of all its virtue -- and then presumably moved on to his next conquest.

But to the rest, those who support Trump, it was the quintessential way of showing his unapologetic patriotism. It was honest and earnest. It wasn't fancy or philosophical. It wasn't intellectual or complicated. Hugging the flag is nothing if not literal. It was the way Trump approached his entire presidency, much to their great satisfaction.

JUST WATCHED Kristol: 'We're now in late stage Trumpism' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kristol: 'We're now in late stage Trumpism' 02:23

The wide chasm separating these two interpretations of the flag moment is also illustrative of another great divide. It's not between left and right -- there are actually a number of crossover issues right now that have found strange bedfellows among Democrats and Republicans, criminal justice reform being just one.

The divide is between Trump supporters and Trump opponents. That may sound obvious in an era when some are allegedly punching each other out. But the interpretations of all things Trump are so divergent, so disparate from one another, that there isn't even a common language set to describe what each is seeing.

This plays out most vividly on social media, where Trump opposition and support are marshaled and weaponized to absurdist degrees. An opinion is voiced, and a hoard of barbarians immediately descend to deem it insufficiently extreme. An anti-Trump comment is almost always denounced not only by Trump supporters but by Trump opponents who don't think it went far enough, encompassed enough targets, condemned enough people. And vice versa for a pro-Trump comment.

There's no room for saying this piece was rotten, but the whole is healthy. There's no gray area, no nuance, no fine lines, no ""let's meet in the middle."" I've fallen into this trap myself, demeaning some Trump supporters as ""Trumpkins.""

These insane purity tests of loyalty and disloyalty to a single person, albeit the President, and the urge to cast entire categories of people as pariahs are all to Trump's advantage and not to ours. In making his presidency a referendum on fealty to him, he has sown a toxic and corrosive division in the country that makes even the simplest of images -- hugging a flag, for instance -- impossible to interpret.

The same will go for his presidency. Americans will have vastly different views of what these years meant for the country. The long view of history usually reaches some consensus version of what happened, but there might never be one for Trump's tenure. Was it an assault on the nation?

npr,Democratic Rep. Jame Raskin Discusses Sweeping Probe Into Trump's Inner Circle,"Democratic Rep. Jame Raskin Discusses Sweeping Probe Into Trump's Inner Circle

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

March 18, two weeks from today - that is the deadline for responses to the House Judiciary Committee, which today launched a sweeping probe into Donald Trump's inner circles. The committee is demanding documents from 81 individuals, business entities and agencies. On the list are Trump family members, such as Don Jr. and Eric Trump, also names now familiar from the Russia investigations - think Roger Stone, Carter Page, Paul Manafort - and organizations, from WikiLeaks to the NRA to the FBI. We are now joined by a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland. Congressman, welcome.

JAMIE RASKIN: Happy to be with you.

KELLY: In a sentence or two, would you lay out briefly for me the key questions you are hoping to answer here.

RASKIN: Well, these are wide-ranging requests that go from everything connected to the Russia probe, the Trump Tower meeting, the firing of James Comey, the attempt to interfere with the Mueller investigation, to emoluments, foreign payments made to the president and his inner circle, to the hush money payoffs paid to the various mistresses, to the catch-and-kill practices conducted by the National Enquirer and its parent company. You name it. It's all in there.

Essentially there were two years of nonexistent oversight run by the Republicans in the House of Representatives, and those days are over now. This is real oversight. We want to get to the bottom of all of the corruption and criminality that have pervaded the White House over the last few years.

KELLY: You said you name it; it's all in there. And this is a fact not lost on Republican members of the committee who point out that 81 requests is a lot. I want to let you hear what the ranking Republican on your committee - this is Georgia's Doug Collins - what he had to say about this today on FOX News Radio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DOUG COLLINS: So now they're just saying, oops, what Mueller report? Oh, that's still coming out, but no, we're going to investigate everything else we possibly can. We started it last week with Cohen. We've seen it now in what Jerry, the chairman's, going to do.

KELLY: Referring to Jerry Nadler there - so Congressman Raskin, let me ask you to respond to, that - he says you Democrats are investigating everything. Is this a fishing expedition?

RASKIN: Well, first of all, they tried to prevent the special counsel from forming. They've done everything in their power to undermine the special counsel, to sandbag the special counsel and to put the work of the special counsel into a straitjacket. And...

KELLY: But to focus on what you're doing, 81 requests - that's a lot.

RASKIN: Well, there are dozens of problems, and they range from the manipulation of the security clearance process, which is very dangerous to our national security, to attempts by the president to stifle the neutral enforcement of the laws at the Department of Justice, to the infiltration of Russian mob money and oligarch money into American politics, the interference with the 2016 presidential election. So if the Republicans...

KELLY: So you're saying it's a lot of requests but because there's a lot to investigate.

RASKIN: There are a lot of problems. And if the Republicans don't want to be part of it, they don't have to be part of it. But the American people have a right to know, and Congress needs to get to the bottom of all of these scandals that have been swirling around the surface of the Trump administration.

KELLY: The Mueller report came up, and I want to ask. Is part of your motive here that if the Mueller report is not made public or not made fully public, that you've done some of your own legwork and put what you found in the public domain?

RASKIN: That might be a little part of it, but remember; we've got an independent institutional responsibility as the people's representatives in the House to conduct constitutional oversight. That's our job. We've got to be doing that. If there were never a special counsel investigation, we still would have to be doing all of this. So you know, the special counsel's work is neither necessary nor necessarily sufficient to any kinds of actions that we would take. We've got an independent constitutional responsibility.

KELLY: That is Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, and we will leave it there. Congressman, thanks so much.

RASKIN: Pleasure's all mine.

cnn,Detained physician puts Trump-Saudi relations back in spotlight,"(CNN) The Trump White House's mysterious and controversial relationship with Saudi Arabia is under fresh scrutiny over the case of a US-Saudi citizen who has reportedly been jailed, beaten and tortured in the kingdom.

The fate of physician Walid Fitaihi is again raising the question of whether strongmen leaders who are crucial to the personal political projects of administration power players are getting a pass on human rights.

Fitaihi was detained in a sweep against prominent Saudi figures orchestrated by the kingdom's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in November 2017 and was initially held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh.

His lawyer said he was then transferred to prison, where he has been held for nearly a year without due process, a period in which his health and emotional state have deteriorated.

President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was in Saudi Arabia last week to push his Middle East peace initiative and is close to the Crown Prince. But there has been no public indication that Kushner advocated on behalf of Fitaihi or inquired about the terms of his detention.

There is already bipartisan anger in Washington over the administration's response to the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi i n the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year.

CNN has reported that US intelligence agencies have concluded that the killing and dismembering of the journalist was ordered by the Crown Prince, despite the Saudi government's denials.

The administration infuriated senators by ignoring a February deadline to provide a report on the murder, and Trump has repeatedly warned that Saudi Arabia's purchases of US weapons and its role in helping the administration confront Iran are not worth jeopardizing over the episode.

US-Saudi relations under rare scrutiny

The fallout of the Khashoggi case and the brutality of the Saudi military intervention in Yemen have provoked rare unity in the Senate, with members of both parties questioning the utility and morality of America's alliance with a Gulf ally that has been an anchor of Washington's Middle East policy for decades.

Despite increasing coverage of the Fitaihi case, there is little sign that the administration is making his detention a high priority or is willing to consider it in the wider context of US-Saudi relations.

National security adviser John Bolton told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that ""as of this moment, my understanding is we have had what's called consular access, meaning American diplomats in Saudi Arabia have visited with him.""

""Beyond that, we don't really have any additional information at this point.""

In a statement to CNN on Sunday, the State Department confirmed that Fitaihi is detained in Saudi Arabia and that he was getting consular services.

""We have raised his case with the Government of Saudi Arabia."" the statement said, and a spokesperson added that the department took ""all allegations of abuse and torture extremely seriously.""

The Saudi government has yet to respond to several requests from CNN for a comment on the case of Fitaihi, who qualified for his US citizenship while studying and practicing medicine in the US and then returned to Saudi Arabia to found a hospital in Jeddah and forge a career as a motivational speaker.

In a statement to The New York Times, which first reported on the Fitaihi case, a Saudi Embassy spokesman said the kingdom ""takes any and all allegations of ill-treatment of defendants awaiting trial or prisoners serving their sentences very seriously.""

The quiet US handling of Fitaihi's detention contrasts with the way Trump has dealt with other cases of Americans imprisoned abroad. He has often boasted about getting US detainees home from North Korea, for example.

He celebrated the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker , by inviting her to the Oval Office after top aides said he had engaged behind the scenes with top leaders in Cairo to win her release.

The administration made the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson in Turkey a diplomatic sticking point in the tense relations between the NATO allies. Brunson also earned an Oval Office invite to thank the President.

Trump frequently claimed credit for the return from North Korea of imprisoned US tourist Otto Warmbier even though he was in a vegetative state and later died.

Last week, after meeting with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam, the President said he took at face value the North Korean dictator's word that he did not know about Warmbier's ill treatment in prison, earning a rebuke from the dead man's parents.

Given the strategic importance of an American prisoner and Kim's rule of fear, most North Korea analysts and even many of Trump's GOP allies think the President's comment lacks credibility.

The administration has often been selective about pointing out human rights abuses in a way that seems to align with its political priorities.

It has used the issue as a cudgel against Venezuela and Iran, but soft-pedaled with Saudi Arabia and North Korea.

The New York Times reported on Saturday that Fitaihi told a friend he had been slapped, stripped, blindfolded and tortured with electricity before he was taken to jail from the Ritz-Carlton.

In a letter to the State Department in January, Fitaihi's lawyer Howard Cooper said his client had been able to speak briefly to his mother on the phone. He told her that ""he is fear of his life, that he cannot take his situation any longer and that he desires all help possible.""",2019,03,04,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/us-saudi-prisoner-diplomacy-kushner-donald-trump/index.html
politico,HUD’s Carson says he will leave after Trump’s first term,"Pressed on whether he would be interested in serving during a second Trump term, Ben Carson said he would be ""interested in returning to the private sector."" | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Finance HUD’s Carson says he will leave after Trump’s first term

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said he will leave office at the end of President Donald Trump’s first term, saying he could have a greater impact in the private sector.

“I will certainly finish out this term,” Carson told Newsmax TV’s John Gizzi in an interview on Monday night.

Story Continued Below

Pressed on whether he would be interested in serving during a second Trump term, Carson responded, “I would be interested in returning to the private sector, because I think you have just as much influence — maybe more — there.”

He released a statement late Monday in response to questions about his comments, saying he “always stand[s] ready to serve this great President and the United States of America.”

Carson, who oversaw a campaign to weaken fair housing enforcement and advocated dramatic budget cuts at the department, is the only black member of Trump’s cabinet – a point Gizzi raised as he asked him about former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen telling Congress last week that Trump is a racist.

“I think Cohen is trying to ingratiate himself to the people who hate Trump,” Carson said. “I’ve never seen anything that even remotely would remind me of racists, and believe me, I recognize a racist when I see them.”

Carson drew criticism from Democrats for dialing back the department’s efforts to fight housing discrimination after postponing the implementation of the Obama-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, a move that prompted civil rights groups to file suit.

“I don’t have any problem with affirmative action or integration -- I have no problem with that at all,” Carson said during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2017. “But I do have a problem with people on high dictating it when they have no idea what’s going on in an area.”

Last year, HUD leaders also floated changing the mission statement to omit references to discrimination and inclusivity, provoking an outcry among housing advocates on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act.

Carson, a former neurosurgeon, has often seemed most at home talking about the health effects of substandard housing, riffing on the impacts of lead paint and mold on the developing brain.

He twice touted proposals to slash HUD’s budget that were quickly rejected by Congress, which instead boosted funding for popular agency programs that the Trump administration had sought to scrap.

And while Carson has been one of the lower-profile Cabinet secretaries, his tenure included a brush with scandal when he ordered a $31,000 dining table for his office suite. Carson and HUD officials offered shifting and contradictory explanations

for the order, which was canceled after the price tag became public last year.

“I can tell you what I said, I can tell you what I did; I do not intend to be responsible for what anyone else said,” Carson told Congress of the initial explanation from his spokesman that career employees made the purchase without his knowledge.

Carson told House Appropriators that he had left the table decision to his wife and was unaware of the cost until he saw it in news reports. Federal law prohibits the head of a department spending more than $5,000 on refurnishing an office without getting advance approval from Congress.

Appearing to blame his wife for the table controversy wasn’t the first time the soft-spoken physician committed a gaffe.

In his first speech to agency staff, Carson caused a minor uproar when he suggested that slaves brought to America in chains were “immigrants” who dreamed of better lives for their children. He called poverty “a state of mind” in a radio interview. And he frequently referred to God and religion in his speeches to the agency, to the chagrin of employees and industry analysts seeking guidance on his housing policy priorities.

Carson faced scrutiny from the moment his name was floated for the position overseeing HUD’s roughly 8,000 employees and nearly $50 billion budget. He initially resisted joining the administration, with confidant Armstrong Williams telling the Hill that “Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he's never run a federal agency“ — an odd admission, since Carson had sought the Republican presidential nomination.

In his confirmation hearing, Carson referred to his experience growing up poor in Detroit, telling the Senate Banking panel, “I understand housing insecurity.” He was confirmed on a 58-41 vote.

Carson had been a Trump adviser during the 2016 campaign after dropping out of the primary race.

nytimes,Opinion | How Giuliani Might Take Down Trump,"RICO was precisely designed to catch the godfathers and bosses at the top of these crime syndicates — people a step or two removed from the actual crimes committed, those whose will is made real, even without a direct order.

Exactly, it appears, as Mr. Trump did at the top of his family business: “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates,” Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said, “doesn’t give orders. He speaks in code. And I understand that code.”

What’s notable about Mr. Cohen’s comments is how they paint a consistent (and credible) pattern of Mr. Trump’s behavior: The former F.B.I. director James Comey, in testimony nearly two years ago in the wake of his firing, made almost exactly the same point and used almost exactly the same language. Mr. Trump never directly ordered him to drop the Flynn investigation, Mr. Comey said, but he made it all too clear what he wanted — the president isolated Mr. Comey, with no other ears around, and then said he hoped Mr. Comey “can let this go.” As Mr. Comey said, “I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.” He cited in his testimony then the famous example of King Henry II’s saying, “Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?,” a question that resulted in the murder of that very meddlesome priest, Thomas Becket.

The sheer number and breadth of the investigations into Mr. Trump’s orbit these days indicates how vulnerable the president’s family business would be to just this type of prosecution. In December, I counted 17, and since then, investigators have started an inquiry into undocumented workers at Mr. Trump’s New Jersey golf course, another crime that could be a RICO predicate; Mr. Cohen’s public testimony itself, where he certainly laid out enough evidence and bread crumbs for prosecutors to verify his allegations, mentioned enough criminal activity to build a racketeering case. Moreover, RICO allows prosecutors to wrap 10 years of racketeering activity into a single set of charges, which is to say, almost precisely the length of time — a decade — that Michael Cohen would have unparalleled insight into Mr. Trump’s operations. Similarly, many Mafia cases end up being built on wiretaps — just like, for instance, the perhaps 100 recordings Mr. Cohen says he made of people during his tenure working for Mr. Trump, recordings that federal investigators are surely poring over as part of the 290,000 documents and files they seized in their April raid last year.

Indicting the whole Trump Organization as a “corrupt enterprise” could also help prosecutors address the thorny question of whether the president can be indicted in office; they could lay out a whole pattern of criminal activity, indict numerous players — including perhaps Trump family members — and leave the president himself as a named, unindicted co-conspirator. Such an action would allow investigators to make public all the known activity for Congress and the public to consider as part of impeachment hearings or re-election. It would also activate powerful forfeiture tools for prosecutors that could allow them to seize the Trump Organization’s assets and cut off its income streams.

The irony will be that if federal prosecutors decide to move against President Trump’s empire and family together, he’ll have one man’s model to thank: his own TV lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who perfected the template to tackle precisely that type of criminal enterprise.",2019,03,04,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/opinion/rudy-giuliani-trump.html
thedailybeast,The Guy Trump Called ‘Fat Jerry’ Is Chairman Nadler Now,"Long before there was Crooked Hillary and Lyin’ Ted, there was Fat Jerry.

That 1995 bit of name-calling by Donald Trump was aimed at Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat from New York who now serves as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

The insult may not make much sense to those who have begun taking notice of Nadler only now that he has sent out more than 80 letters to individuals and entities asking for a wide range of documents relating to their dealings with Trump.

But the present Nadler is a person transformed since he underwent stomach-reduction surgery in 2001 and shed more than 100 pounds. He had been noshing himself toward a peak weight of 328 pounds back when he first roused Trump’s ire.

Their original object of contention was Television City, a metropolis within a metropolis that Trump proposed on a 52-acre tract he acquired on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in the 1980s. The initial plan was for eight towers and 5,700 apartments, as well as television and movie studios.

Nadler met with Trump as the state assemblyman who then represented the area. Trump excitedly told him that the centerpiece would be a 150-story building, the tallest in the world. The lower floors were to be NBC’s new headquarters. Trump would of course occupy a palatial penthouse apartment at the very top.

“Above the clouds,” he told Nadler.

“New Yorkers want the tallest building,” Trump also said. “And so do I.”

Nadler was more of the opinion that New Yorkers wanted an affordable apartment. He opposed Trump’s project, viewing it as a neighborhood-destroyer. Enough of the neighborhood agreed with him that he was elected to Congress after the incumbent, Rep. Ted Weiss, died the day before the primary in 1992.

Mayor Ed Koch had also opposed the project and thought he had killed it when he used generous tax abatements such as Trump had wanted for Television City to convince NBC to remain at Rockefeller Center. Koch engaged in a bit of name-calling himself as he made clear his feelings regarding Trump.

“Piggy! Piggy! Piggy!” Koch said.

Whatever else Trump might have been, he was also determined. He nixed the world’s tallest building and reduced the number of apartments planned to 4,000. But, lest anyone think he was defeated, he changed the name of the project from Television City to Trump City. He changed it again to Riverside South as he sought to finance the project with a $356 million low-interest loan guaranteed by a federal program designed to generate low- and moderate-income housing.

The Housing and Urban Development inspector general issued a 1997 report that called the proposed financing into question. The IG noted that more than 80 percent of the apartments in the Trump project would be affordable only to upper-income individuals.

“Trump’s mortgage guaranty application is purely a ploy to get taxpayers to foot the bill for his luxury housing mega-development,” Nadler said in a statement.

The IG also noted that Trump’s application for mortgage insurance had been refused because the collateral he put up included land that had been promised to the city as a park in an effort to sell the proposal.

“I congratulate HUD for piercing one of Trump’s many scams,” Nadler was quoted saying.

Nadler was joined by Sen. John McCain in opposing the financing. McCain gave a speech from the Senate floor that may have still rankled Trump in 2016. Maybe the truth is that Trump likes war heroes who don’t challenge one of his scams.

“The Department of Housing and Urban Development is processing an application from a team of developers, headed by the venerable Donald Trump,” McCain began.

McCain noted that the loan guarantee would entitle Trump to “a vast array of municipal tax benefits, which one group calculates to be in the range of nearly $4.5 million per ‘needy’ individual assisted.”

“Not exactly what most Americans would consider cost-effective use of government assistance,” McCain said. “I certainly have nothing against luxury apartments nor do I have anything against very successful project developers, including Mr. Trump. I do object, however, to asking the taxpayer to bear the risk of a development for one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in the country, to help finance a project that will predominantly benefit upper-income Americans.”

McCain noted, “Congressman Nadler, who represents the area in the House and who is a member on the other side of the aisle, does not consider the area around the development site to be blighted and he opposes the project.”

McCain went on, a principled conservative Republican expressing an opinion he shared with the ultra-liberal Nadler: “The Donald Trumps of the world can more than afford to bear the risk of their endeavors, and should not be indemnified with taxpayer dollars.”

By that point, Trump had already gone into multiple corporate bankruptcies. He was rescued from personal bankruptcy when a Hong Kong group led by the Cheng family provided the needed financing.

But Trump was not done with seeking public funds. He sought to have taxpayers spend $350 million to move the West Side Highway so that it no longer ran between his development site and the Hudson River. Nadler was among those who noted that this same stretch of highway had just undergone a $70 million renovation.

“It’s a sin against taxpayers,” Nadler said, terming the proposed highway project “a pork barrel boondoggle.”

Nadler introduced and single-handedly marshaled legislation that ruled out any federal funding for the project beyond what had already been allocated for a feasibility study.

Trump responded with name-calling and spin.

“Fat Jerry Nadler is doing me a favor,” he said. “He’s too stupid to realize it. He’s making me a lot of money.”

Trump argued that moving the highway to allow direct access to the waterfront would have only been a concession to the community and not an effort to make his property more appealing and therefore valuable. He said the highway as presently located would accord a fortune in free advertising once the project was built.

“I have to say we get a bigger benefit from leaving the highway where it is, because when cars go by they will look at our masterpiece,” Trump was quoted saying.

But Trump did not yet have a base that let him name-call with impunity. And, being a mix of every possible kind of person, New York prizes fairness and tolerance more than most places.

Trump ended up saying he had only referred to Nadler as “Fat Jerry” out of concern for his health.

“I did it for a reason,” he told the New York Daily News. “I really feel that whatever can inspire him to go out and lose that tremendous amount of weight should be done.”

Trump continued, “To be honest with you, he’s a walking time bomb and if I can convince him to put himself, not in great, but in reasonable shape, I’m doing great service to him and his family.”

And people say Trump is devoid of empathy!

Surely, only modesty prevented him from claiming credit when Nadler had the weight-reduction surgery.

In the meantime, construction had begun on a scaled-down version of Television City, turned Trump City, turned Riverside South. Trump only owned 30 percent of it, but three of the buildings were emblazoned with words that made you think otherwise.

“TRUMP PLACE”

The developer who had once spoken of living above the clouds now sought to draw attention to his far more modest development by hiring magician David Blaine to spend seven days buried alive in a water-filled coffin at Trump Place. Some 75,000 are said to have come to gawk. Blaine afterward reported having a vision that was very New York as Nadler knows the city, but very un-Trumpian.

“Every race, every religion, every age group banding together,” Blaine exulted.

Nadler never responded to Trump’s name-calling, but you can be sure he never forgot it.

And now, Fat Jerry has a new name whose ramifications Trump is only beginning to learn.

cnn,Donald Trump's epically bad week,"Consider these five bad things that happened to him:

: No, Trump's former fixer didn't provide a smoking gun on his old boss. But Cohen did make things worse for Trump on at least three fronts: The hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, along with WikiLeaks and the Trump Tower Moscow development. Cohen produced a check for $35,000 that he said was a partial reimbursement for the payment to Daniels. He said that he heard a phone call between Roger Stone and Trump about WikiLeaks. And he said he had 10 conversations with Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump about the Russia development.

: Trump clearly thought his second summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un might be the one that produced measurable results on the denuclearization front. It didn't -- and Trump left with America and North Korea seemingly on different pages about why the talks broke down.

4. Felix Sater will be testifying publicly later this month: After Cohen's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up Thursday, committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced that : After Cohen's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up Thursday, committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced that Sater would be appearing in an open hearing before the committee March 14. Sater, a former FBI informant and a man who spent time in prison for stabbing a man in the face with a broken margarita glass, was the one who suggested to Cohen that Trump build in Moscow. And, oh yeah, Cohen will also be back to offer more testimony to House Intelligence on March 6.

5. Otto Warmbier's parents blast his comment on Kim: Just before leaving the North Korea summit in Vietnam, Trump was asked about North Korea's 18-month imprisonment of Warmbier, a college student who died shortly after being returned to the United States.

""(Kim) tells me that he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word,"" Trump said . Warmbier's parents, who had been supportive of Trump for getting their son back, released a scathing statement : ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. ...

cnn,Impending Mueller report may just be the beginning of Trump's investigation woes,"(CNN) The impeachment of President Donald Trump suddenly looks like much more than just a theoretical possibility.

Democrats on Monday will launch an ""abuse of power"" investigation that could be easily transformed into an even more serious process, with an expansive demand for documents from Trump's government, his family and even his real estate empire.

The President reacted to his worsening plight with a vehement defense on Sunday, after a week in which testimony from his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen deepened his political vulnerability and ahead of the expected filing soon of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

""Presidential Harassment by 'crazed' Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise, the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure,"" Trump tweeted Sunday night.

Presidential Harassment by ""crazed"" Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise, the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure - Yet the most successful first two years for any

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, who would eventually lead any impeachment proceedings, on Sunday signaled a significant escalation into congressional inquiries into the President.

The New York Democrat plans on Monday to request documents from 60 people and entities close to Trump, including from the Department of Justice, the White House and the Trump Organization.

The document trawl will be used ""to present the case to the American people about obstruction of justice, about corruption and abuse of power,"" Nadler said on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday.

Nadler stuck to the House Democratic position that impeachment ""is a long way down the road,"" apparently in order to avoid Republican arguments that the decision has already been made to try to oust Trump. The document requests are not taking place under the auspices of an official impeachment investigation.

But Nadler said nevertheless that he believes the President had obstructed justice, a potentially impeachable offense.

And given his responsibilities and powers, the warning from Nadler took the President's political and legal nightmare to a new plane, and opened a new, more serious stage of the showdown between House Democrats and Trump.

It was the latest sign that investigations sparked by accusations that Trump's campaign team cooperated with Russian election meddling has mushroomed into a relentless examination of Trump's political, personal and business life.

The latest blow to the President further intensified pressure on the White House as Washington waits for another shoe to drop — with Mueller expected to file his long awaited report from Monday onward.

The Nadler investigation, along with parallel probes into Trump's presidency by the House Oversight and Intelligence committees means that the structure of a political investigation into the President based in Congress is now in place, alongside the legal inquiries led by Mueller and prosecutors in New York and other jurisdictions.

Trump showing signs of stress

In the last week, partly through Cohen's testimony, it has become clear that even if the special counsel does not find direct wrongdoing by the President, Trump's legal troubles will linger deep into his presidency and probably beyond.

Trump is showing increasing signs of stress at being surrounded.

He spent much of the weekend laying out a likely defense should any of the multiple probes find him guilty of wrongdoing and bolstering his stranglehold on the Republican Party that could eventually be key to saving his presidency in a Senate trial if House Democrats opt for impeachment.

""I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election!"" Trump tweeted Sunday

In a mostly unscripted two-hour speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday — one of the most demagogic and inflammatory appearances of his presidency, Trump lacerated Mueller and his investigation

""So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out ... who we're dealing with ... We're waiting for a report by people that weren't elected,"" Trump said at CPAC.

""You put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there, and all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit, OK,"" Trump said.

Trump also sketched a defense for two potential areas of vulnerability: his call for Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails during the 2016 campaign and his firing of former FBI Director James Comey in 2017.

He said he was being ""sarcastic"" when he asked Russia to find Clinton's emails and was having fun with his audience.

Mueller's team has already filed an indictment against 12 Russian intelligence operatives, accusing them of hacking into Clinton's personal emails for the first time on the same day — July 27, 2016 — as Trump's appeal.

Trump's comment is often cited by his critics as an instance in which his campaign colluded in plain sight with the Russian election meddling effort.

The President also used his speech at CPAC to knock back accusations that his firing of Comey was an attempt to shut down the Russia investigation and therefore fits the definition of obstruction of justice.

""I said, 'Melania, I'm doing something today, I'm doing it because it really has to be done ... he's a bad, bad guy,'"" Trump said, arguing that he thought Democrats would welcome the move given their anger at Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation.

""I said to the first lady, I said, 'but you know the good news, the good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan, everyone's going to love it' — so we fired Comey.""

In May 2017, Trump told NBC News that he was thinking of the ""Russia thing"" when he dismissed Comey.

His lawyers have argued that since he is the titular head of the US government and legal system, the President has the right to dismiss anyone in the executive branch and therefore cannot be guilty of obstruction.

It may soon be Mueller time

Mueller has not so far produced any evidence that Trump is guilty of cooperating with the Russian election interference effort, or of obstructing justice.

He has however sprinkled tantalizing clues in indictments of a handful of Trump associates that have sparked intrigue about what his eventual findings — that will be presented to Attorney General William Barr — will show.

In a moment that will have dramatic overtones given the timing, Barr is due to deliver brief remarks on Monday at an event at the White House hosted by the President for state attorneys general, a Justice Department spokesman said.

Trump's fierce political campaign against what he calls Mueller's ""Witch Hunt"" and ""hoax"" investigation is apparently aimed at discrediting any conclusions that Barr choses to share with Congress and the public.

But his increasingly emotional denunciation of the various legal and political investigations — that are now focusing on his business, his campaign, his transition, his inauguration and his presidency is not giving the impression that he is a President who is confident there will be no charges to answer.

Nadler is expected to give further details of his document request on Monday.

But he said on ABC that it would stretch from the White House, to the Department of Justice to Trump's son, Donald Jr., and Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization.

Given that he believes that Trump obstructed justice, Nadler was asked on ""This Week"" whether the decision not to pursue a formal impeachment investigation at this point was merely a political distinction.

""We do not now have the evidence sorted out and everything to do an impeachment. Before you impeach somebody you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen. You have to persuade enough of the opposition party voters, the Trump voters,"" Nadler said.

Republicans accused Nadler and fellow Democrats of lining up a fall back investigation to pursue the President in case Mueller does not find offenses that rise to the level of impeachment.

""I think Congressman Nadler decided to impeach the President the day the President won the election,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on ""This Week.""

""He talks about impeachment before he even became chairman and then he says, you've got to persuade people to get there.""

McCarthy also argued that the hush money payments made by Trump to two women who accused him of affairs before the election did not amount to the standard of impeachable offenses.

Cohen last week produced a check for $35,000 which he said was proof that Trump was reimbursing him for what may amount to an infringement of campaign finance laws even while he was in office.

But McCarthy argued that campaign finance violations merit a fine, not the ultimate sanction Congress can take against a President.

""Those aren't impeachable in the process,"" he said.",2019,03,04,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/trump-mueller-report-nadler-investigation-impeachment/index.html
aljazeera,Trump's 'ultimate deal' faces ultimate failure,"At a private gathering at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London on February 28, David Makovsky and Dennis Ross - two men with a deep understanding of the decades-long peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis - spoke frankly and at length about US President Donald Trump's ""ultimate deal"".

Makovsky is an author and journalist who covered the often anguished twists and turns of the journey to reach the Oslo accords of 1993 and 1995. Ross was appointed President Bill Clinton's Middle East envoy in the first Clinton administration and in that capacity helped to broker the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly referred to as Oslo II in 1995.

Both men are seen by critics - justifiably or not - as being sympathetic towards Israel: Makovsky is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) which is closely linked to the pro-Israeli lobby AIPAC; Ross, after leaving his post as envoy, returned to WINEP as a counsellor and distinguished fellow.

What was abundantly clear from their comments was that the peace deal, whose details remain a closely held secret, is doomed to failure. As Makovsky put it ""if it was left to the advisers, they would say do not pursue this deal."" He added that the risk of failure was high and ""every failure comes with a cost"".

This is the fourth attempt at a comprehensive peace deal and the cynicism on both sides, after decades of effort, is running higher than ever before. Ross noted that ""both sides have lost faith""; without faith, he argued, there is no chance of a deal. ""What has been completely lost is the sense that there is the possibility a deal can be reached. That possibility has to somehow be recreated.""

Resurrecting the peace process is a major challenge in itself, but what makes it even more difficult to achieve for the Trump administration is the fact that the triumvirate delegated with this mission - Trump's son-in-law Kushner, Trump Organisation lawyer Jason Greenblatt and Trump campaign adviser David Friedman - is seen as closely linked to the illegal settler movement in the West Bank.

Kushner's family foundation has funded a settlement. Friedman, Trump's appointee as ambassador to Israel, has argued that the settlements, contrary to international law, are not illegal. Greenblatt, confounding experts as well as common sense, has decreed that the settlements are ""not an obstacle to peace"".

In keeping with the president's approach to foreign affairs, Kushner has eschewed the systems and structures that in normal times are used as essential tools of diplomacy. He shares his father-in-law's egotistic view that he has no need for the machinery of government nor the thoughts of wiser and older Middle East experts. In his very limited world view, this is just another Manhattan real estate deal writ large.

Makovsky called the triumvirate's approach ""close-holed""; other practitioners see the obsession for secrecy and the refusal to consult knowledgeable Middle East peace negotiators as simply paranoid.

No wonder then that there is an absence of faith on the Palestinian side. Kushner seems to believe that his project, which Makovsky called ""economy plus-plus"", will convince the Palestinian leadership to give up some, if not all, of their ""hot button"" issues in return for economic benefits. These core issues remain the right of return for refugees, borders based on the 1967 Green Line, security and occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of a viable Palestinian state.

The benefits that are supposed to flow, in Kushner's mind, like water in the desert, will come in part from the largesse of the Gulf states, in particular, Saudi Arabia. He, of course, has a special relationship with the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). (The crown prince has boasted that he has Kushner ""in his pocket"" so the relationship may not be quite what Kushner thinks it is.)

However, the Saudis are not prepared to stump up unless the US does too. Given Trump's erratic and unpredictable approach to foreign policy, there is no guarantee whatsoever that will happen, a point not lost at all on the Saudis.

While it is true that Israel has worked assiduously to gain the support of key Gulf leaders, who view it as a bulwark of support against Iran, Ross said that ""Arab leaders will never say publicly to the Palestinians that you must accept the (Kushner) deal.""

In a best-case scenario, he said, Arab leaders could say ""we have questions and reservations but this does form the basis for negotiations"" - in other words, a starting point and nothing more. Then the strategy would be to get Europe on side. That would leave the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in a bind and in Ross' opinion he would be ""forced to come to the table.""

However, the only way that could work is if the key demands, the hot buttons, of the Palestinians are met in the plan. While virtually nothing else is known about the 50-page document that Kushner has prepared, it is clear that it does not address these demands in any meaningful way.

Makovsky expressed his concern that the deal was ""set up for failure"", and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""was counting on Abbas to say no"", thus delivering to the hard-right settlement parties the result they wanted after supporting his re-election bid.

With news that the Israeli attorney general will proceed to indict the prime minister on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust, the election itself has been thrown wide open. Trump and Kushner have intimated that ""the deal of the century"" will be released sometime after the election on April 9. But whereas before it would have tumbled out in a political space secure in Netanyahu's re-election, now the deal faces uncertainty in Israel as well as the anger of the Palestinians.

No one who has given it much thought really expects the plan to do anything other than fail. But when seasoned veterans like Makovsky and Ross confirm that view, it is a safe bet that Trump, the self-proclaimed great dealmaker who fell flat on his face at the Vietnam summit, is set for a repeat performance in a fractious and volatile Middle East.

cnn,Mitch McConnell can't protect Trump from vetoes anymore,"(CNN) President Donald Trump has a perfect veto-free record so far, the result of support from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and, until they lost their majority, Republicans in the US House.

But that could change now that the Democrats in charge of the House have rebuked the President over his declaration of a national emergency at the US border.

McConnell won't be able to make the bill go away by tabling it or rallying a filibuster and it's likely that enough Senate Republicans will vote with Democrats to send the measure of disapproval for the national emergency to the President's desk.

So the President might be faced with finally issuing a veto in order to continue his effort to get around lawmakers of both parties to gather more money for his wall on the southern border.

It's been almost 140 years since a US president didn't veto anything during his time in the White House. And that President, James Garfield, was assassinated before he could serve a full year in office in 1881.

If he issues a veto soon, Trump will fall somewhere after Garfield and George W. Bush, who served a full four-year term without issuing a veto. But Bush made up for lost time in his second term, especially when Democrats took control of the House and the Senate in 2007.

A number of Republican senators have expressed a willingness to break with Trump over the national emergency declaration. And 13 Republican representatives have already sided with Democrats on the issue.

That's enough to force his veto, but not nearly enough to overturn it.

The vote overturning the national emergency declaration is not subject to filibuster rules, so a simple majority can pass the measure through the Senate. There are 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who vote with Democrats. Four Republican senators, two of whom are up for re-election in 2020, have said they will vote with Democrats and against Trump:

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky

What happens after a Trump veto?

There's a big difference between forcing a veto and overturning it. Vetoes can be overridden only by a two-thirds supermajority vote in both chambers on Capitol Hill. In the House, Democrats have 235 seats, Republicans have 197 and there are three vacancies. Since the measure overturning the national emergency won 245 votes there, that means Democrats would have to pick up an additional 43 to 45 House Republican votes to get to 288-290 and a two-thirds majority, depending on how many lawmakers vote. Assuming the bill passes in the Senate with four Republicans, they'd need to pick up an additional 16 Republican votes.

How uncommon is Trump's veto-free streak?

We're taking for granted that presidents would not want to use the veto, but some clearly relish their fights against Congress. Harry Truman, who issued 250 vetoes, ran a successful re-election campaign in 1948 against the ""do nothing"" Congress. The most veto-happy President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, read a veto message aloud to Congress.

In Trump's case, though, if he must veto his national emergency declaration, it will underline that he is pushing a policy opposed by most of the country.

Still, presidential vetoes occur more often than you might think. Every president since Garfield has vetoed at least one bill. The younger Bush was the first president since John Quincy Adams to go a full four years without a veto, according to the Congressional Research Service. The House, which was Republican-led for Bush's entire first term, was protecting him from bills he opposed. Barack Obama, similarly, had help on Capitol Hill for most of his presidency, just as Trump has. But Obama did veto two bills even when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress.

The President with the most vetoes was Democrat Roosevelt, with 635, although he also served the longest in the White House (12 years). All those vetoes came even though Roosevelt enjoyed Democratic majorities for his entire time in the White House.

If you plot vetoes alongside how closely aligned Congress is to the president, it used to be quite common for a president to veto bills from a House and Senate aligned with him. This data comes from The American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara

But that's changed in modern history. If you look only at vetoes since 1972, when Richard Nixon faced a Democratic-led Congress, most of the vetoes have come when at least one chamber was not aligned with the President.

Veto overrides, of course, are much more rare than vetoes. There have been only 111 in the history of the country, and they have impact.

One of the country's few impeachments, Andrew Johnson's, was precipitated by a veto override

In more recent history, the Clean Water Act in 1972 and an expansion of the Freedom of Information Act in 1974 both passed despite presidential vetoes. The last time an appropriations bill was overridden was during Ronald Reagan's administration in 1982, according to The American Presidency Project",2019,03,02,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/02/politics/trump-presidents-veto-congress-history-override-national-emergency/index.html

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shannon Dooling/WBUR Shannon Dooling/WBUR

More than four decades after the Vietnam War brought waves of expatriates to the United States, the Trump administration wants to deport thousands of Vietnamese immigrants, including many refugees, because of years-old criminal convictions.

U.S. officials have been working behind the scenes to convince the Vietnamese government to repatriate more than 7,000 Vietnamese immigrants with criminal convictions. They have all been ordered removed from the U.S. by a judge.

Among those facing deportation is Vu, who has lived in Boston for 20 years. He asked not to use his last name because he fears for his safety if he ever goes back to Vietnam.

""They don't like me [in Vietnam] because I'm Amerasian. They would tease me and throw rocks at me,"" he says through a translator, looking down at the floor. ""Over here it's much better. No one gives me trouble. No one hassles me, and no one throws rocks at me.""

The U.S. government is trying to deport Vu over two criminal charges of assault and larceny dating back to 2001, even though both of those convictions have since been vacated.

At the moment, however, Vietnam won't repatriate immigrants like Vu. The country only accepts Vietnamese who went to the United States after 1995, the year the two countries resumed diplomatic relations. That's been the agreement since 2008.

""After years of negotiating, Vietnam essentially agreed to take back people who came to the U.S. after 1995 but not those that came to the U.S. before 1995,"" says Phi Nguyen with the civil rights group Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta.

Now, the Trump administration wants to expand on that agreement to be able to deport Vietnamese immigrants who came here before 1995 and have committed a crime.

Critics say some of the immigrants committed nonviolent offenses or served their time years ago, and many wouldn't have been considered priorities for deportation under previous administrations. Moreover, critics say, some of the immigrants came to the U.S. as refugees, seeking protection.

""They were forced to come here, in many ways, because of the war that was happening in their country,"" says Bethany Li, director of the Asian Outreach Unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.

Vu was born in Saigon in 1967. His father was a U.S. serviceman fighting in the country, and he barely knew his mother. Vu says she abandoned him at a young age. He describes the relentless discrimination he faced in Vietnam, with people calling him a ""dirty birth.""

I think about it often and I don't want to be deported. I wouldn't be able to see my children. I would lose everything. I would miss most being around my kids.

Vu wasn't alone. Thousands of war babies were born into similar situations, facing isolation and derision. Many, like Vu, took advantage of a program that allowed Amerasians to get residency in the U.S.

Now, in Boston, he has a steady job, a longtime partner and two U.S. citizen children. He doesn't want to return to Vietnam, but he might not have a choice.

""I think about it often and I don't want to be deported,"" he says, wiping tears from his face. ""I wouldn't be able to see my children. I would lose everything. I would miss most being around my kids.""

Katie Waldman, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, says removing these Vietnamese nationals is a priority for the administration. They have been convicted of a range of crimes, from burglary and drug charges to violent crimes.

Waldman declined to address efforts to renegotiate the agreement with Vietnam, and the Vietnamese embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

While government officials from both countries are not talking publicly, details of the talks did surface in a related court case brought by some Vietnamese immigrants over their detention by immigration authorities. Those documents show the two governments have been negotiating since at least 2017.

In court filings, Michael V. Bernacke, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that the agency has been negotiating ""to facilitate and return all Vietnamese nationals who have been ordered removed from the United States, regardless of when they originally entered the United States.""

For a time, starting in mid-2017, according to Bernacke, Vietnam ""verbally agreed"" to process travel documents and accept immigrants who went to the U.S. before 1995. Court documents show at least 10 immigrants were deported.

But later on, according to the filings, Vietnam appeared to reverse course and seemed unlikely to take back more pre-1995 immigrants. So Bernacke said that ""ICE will continue to negotiate with the Vietnamese government.""

Nguyen, the Atlanta-based attorney, says the private nature of these talks is stoking anxiety in Vietnamese communities.

""A lot of these conversations do happen behind closed doors, and there's always the fear that something could change tomorrow,"" she says.

On a recent Saturday afternoon at a community center in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, more than a dozen people sit in metal folding chairs, organized in a circle. They lean forward, listening to the free legal advice being offered.

They're all here because they're worried, including Van Nguyen, who says she fled Vietnam and came to the U.S. as a refugee in 1980. She is not related to Phi Nguyen.

""I mean it's kind of, like, hitting home because my husband does not have citizenship, and he's got a past. So we're just kind of very nervous,"" she says.

Nguyen declined to elaborate on her husband's past. He's Amerasian and they worry he could one day be deported to the country that so many fled more than 30 years ago.",2019,03,04,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/699177071/40-years-after-the-vietnam-war-some-refugees-face-deportation-under-trump
theatlantic,The Biggest Consequence of Trump’s New Abortion Rule Won’t Be for Abortion,"Since Title X was established in 1970, the program’s funding has been restricted from going toward abortions. Clinics such as Planned Parenthood that offer abortions—but also health departments, federally qualified health centers, and other Title X grantees that don’t—use the Title X program. The money is used to provide nonabortion health services, such as cancer screenings and birth control, mostly to poor and uninsured women, on a sliding fee scale. If a woman has no money and no insurance, she can, say, get a Pap smear at a lower cost, with the difference covered by Title X money. Title X also pays for staff, training, and community outreach.

The anti-abortion-rights community sees this existing restriction as still too lax. They argue that Trump’s new rule makes it more certain that no government money will go to an entity that provides abortions, and that the rule allows more faith-based organizations to participate in Title X. “We applaud the decision of the administration to ensure that federal family-planning dollars are not used to subsidize abortion operations,” says Steven Aden, the chief legal officer at Americans United for Life. “Any time abortion is advocated as a means of family planning, that’s tax money going to the promotion of elective abortion.”

In Aden’s view, it will not be difficult for Planned Parenthood and other clinics to separate their clinics into abortion and nonabortion facilities. But these clinics maintain that complying with the new rule is not as simple as it seems.

Opponents of this ban sometimes call it a “gag rule.” Aden told me he disagrees with this description. “There’s no gag rule because if they so desire, Title X recipients can still discuss abortion as one of the options,” he said. Still, Planned Parenthood views the rule’s ban on referrals to abortion providers as medically unethical. Leana Wen, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, has said that she will refuse Title X funding if the rule holds up in its current form.

Without that funding, says Kristin Metcalf-Wilson, the senior lead clinician for Planned Parenthood of the Great Plains, many clinics in those states would not have the resources to reduce the fees for nonabortion medical procedures for poor, uninsured women.

If Planned Parenthood loses Title X funding and stops accepting patients on a sliding scale, the rule’s opponents argue, other Title X clinics will not have the capacity to absorb those patients. Metcalf-Wilson says the Title X funding is too large an amount for other funders, such as private donors, to make up for.

Other clinics might decide that the new rule’s requirements are too burdensome, and opt to simply forgo the Title X funding, potentially driving up the costs of their services. “I think there are family-planning providers that will find they will qualify for the [Title X] funds, but the terms are not those that are worth it for them,” says Alina Salganicoff, the director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.",2019,03,05,https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/trumps-title-x-rule-change-planned-parenthood/584005/
nytimes,Opinion | Donald Trump’s Phony America,"Maybe the best book I read last year was “Bad Blood,” about the epic sham of the biotech start-up Theranos and its delusional creator, Elizabeth Holmes. I had trouble shaking it, and it roared back into my mind on Wednesday, when Michael Cohen testified publicly before the House Oversight Committee and retraced the mountain of lies buttressing Donald Trump’s business empire and the clouds of fiction preventing any clear view of it. This country of ours doesn’t lack for frauds, I thought. We were probably bound to elevate one to the highest office in the land.

In November 2016 we did. As anyone paying close attention then knew and anyone who finally woke up over these last few ugly days must now admit, we gave the supreme prize and ultimate compliment — leadership of the most powerful nation on earth — to a man who wouldn’t know the truth if it raced toward him with sirens blaring, ran over him, then backed up and did it again; whose loyalties stand as firm as a strand of overcooked linguine; whose vanity makes Narcissus look like a mere pretender; and who will sacrifice whatever and whomever he must on the altar of his own spurious magnificence. What he lacks in moral fiber he makes up for in gilt. It sufficed to bring him his treasure and, for 72 years and counting, spare him his reckoning.

There are several kinds of success stories. We emphasize the ones starring brilliant inventors and earnest toilers. We celebrate sweat and stamina. We downplay the schemers, the short cuts and the subterfuge. But for every ambitious person who has the goods and is prepared to pay his or her dues, there’s another who doesn’t and is content to play the con. In the Trump era and the Trump orbit, these ambassadors of a darker side of the American dream have come to the fore.

What a con Holmes played with Theranos. For those unfamiliar with the tale, which the journalist John Carreyrou told brilliantly in “Bad Blood,” she dropped out of Stanford at 19 to pursue her Silicon Valley dream, intent on becoming a billionaire and on claiming the same perch in our culture and popular imagination that Steve Jobs did. She modeled her work habits and management style after his. She dressed as he did, in black turtlenecks. She honed a phony voice, deeper than her real one.",2019,03,02,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/opinion/sunday/trump-cohen-theranos-fraud.html

Warren/AP Photo 2020 Elections Jay Inslee calls Trump's wind energy doubts 'moronic'

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday called President Trump's claims about potential negative impacts of the widespread adoption of wind energy ""moronic,"" labeling the president a ""narrow-minded thinker.""

""When Donald Trump said we're not going to have toasters and TVs if we have wind power, that's just simply moronic, is the best way I can say it,"" Inslee, who announced last week that he would run for president, said during an interview with ABC's ""The View.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has long expressed skepticism about climate change despite significant scientific evidence that it exists and is caused largely by human activity. The president has previously suggested, without evidence, that the concept of climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese government to give itself an economic advantage over the U.S.

The president has also championed the use of traditional fossil fuels, the burning of which is a major factor in climate change, and has expressed skepticism about alternative energy sources. Addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump joked that once ""the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric,"" while mocking the Green New Deal proposal backed by many Democrats in Congress.

""Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling,"" Trump joked.

Inslee, who is focusing his campaign on climate change to distinguish himself from the still-growing Democratic field, said that Washington has a $6 billion wind turbine industry. The state requires requires large utilities to obtain 15 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by 2020, which includes solar and wind energy.

""When I turn on 'The View' in the morning, it always comes on,"" Inslee quipped. ""It works really, really well.""

Inslee added that Trump needs to begin understanding that a clean energy economy is possible.

""He is just such a pessimist and a narrow-minded thinker,"" he said. ""He needs to get with the rest of Americans that understand that a country that sent a man to the moon can develop a clean energy economy. That's what we can do. I fundamentally believe it.""",2019,03,04,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/inslee-trump-wind-energy-1201889
cnn,The Jared Kushner security clearance story reveals Donald Trump's two biggest flaws,"(CNN) If you needed one clear example of the fundamental flaws of Donald Trump's presidency, this new reporting out of The New York Times would do the trick nicely: The President reportedly ordered his then-chief of staff John Kelly to secure a top-secret security clearance for his son-in-law Jared Kushner, ignoring the objections of the intelligence community and of Kelly himself.

""It is not known precisely what factors led to the problems with Mr. Kushner's security clearance,"" read the Times report. ""Officials had raised questions about his own and his family's real estate business's ties to foreign governments and investors, and about initially unreported contacts he had with foreigners. The issue also generated criticism of Mr. Trump for having two family members serve in official capacities in the West Wing.""

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Stop and think about this for a second: The President of the United States overrode concerns expressed, according to The New York Times, by intelligence officials, his chief of staff and his White House counsel, to push for a top-secret security clearance for his son-in-law, who, not for nothing, he had endowed with such a broad portfolio that Kushner was referred to as the ""Secretary of Everything"" in the early days of Trump's White House.

That Trump would pull such a power move -- which is legal, yes, but ethically dicey -- speaks to his commitment to nepotism, a trait that has always defined his life in and out of politics. Trump has few close friends or associates, choosing to surround himself with his offspring -- with a handful of ""yes"" men and hangers-on liberally sprinkled in.

Trump's closest advisers in the Trump Organization were his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and his daughter, Ivanka. (Eric and Don now run the day-to-day operations of the company with their father in the White House.) In the 2016 campaign, his three eldest children were again his inner circle, along with Ivanka's husband, Kushner. (Remember that at that meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer in June 2016, only three members of the Trump campaign were present: Trump Jr., Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort.)

And now, in the White House, Trump has Ivanka and Kushner close by, with amorphous job titles and broad mandates. The elevated status of ""Javanka"" -- how has that nickname not caught on more?? -- has rankled all sorts of non-family staffers and led some to leave the administration, often not by their own volition.

That Trump has two family members in such critical positions already raised some eyebrows. That he forced members of his administration to grant Kushner a top-security clearance over the concerns of senior (and career) staffers is deeply troubling -- especially when you consider that without Trump forcing the matter, it seems likely that Kushner would have never received his current top-secret clearance.

Trump's blind nepotism created this: One of the most senior White House staffers, who has a hand in any number of extremely sensitive situations, including attempting to negotiate peace in the Middle East(!), is someone about whom intelligence officials had concerns regarding the potential exposure he could cause the US government. Sit with that for a minute.

Then, consider this second obvious flaw: Trump did not tell the truth when asked directly about the role that he played in securing Kushner's security clearance.

In January, Trump told the Times that he ""was never involved with the security"" clearances regarding Kushner, adding: ""I know that there was issues back and forth about security for numerous people, actually. But I don't want to get involved in that stuff.""

According to the Times -- and later reporting in which The Washington Post confirmed much of the Times report -- Trump was not telling the truth in that interview. Not only did he get ""involved"" with Kushner's security clearance, he ordered Kelly to give Kushner the top-secret clearance over the objections of the then-chief of staff.

(Asked Thursday about that obvious contradiction, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said this to the Times: ""We don't comment on security clearances."")

Nepotism. Ignoring the advice of career officials -- and members of your own staff. And then not telling the truth when called on it. Yes, this is the Trump presidency.",2019,03,01,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/01/politics/jared-kushner-donald-trump-security-clearance/index.html
politico,Kirstjen Nielsen digs in after surviving Trump's wrath,"People close to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen say she’s resolved to remain in her position as long as possible, having finally shaken off distracting speculation about her job security. | Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images white house Kirstjen Nielsen digs in after surviving Trump's wrath The president almost fired his DHS chief for repeatedly saying 'no' to him, but their relationship has turned a corner.

Shortly after President Donald Trump returned last March from a visit to the San Diego border, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen found herself in a familiar place — saying no to her boss.

Trump, who had just surveyed border wall prototypes, wanted to expedite the bidding process and even negotiate some of the contracts himself. Why, he demanded to know in an Oval Office meeting with Nielsen and other officials, couldn’t they make that happen, according to three people briefed on the conversation. “He would get frustrated by the bureaucracy,” including the federal procurement process and land acquisition issues, recalled a former DHS official.

Story Continued Below

“He’s an executive who just wanted to do it immediately,” the former official explained.

Nielsen had been here before. Early in her tenure, Trump would regularly dial her cellphone in anger when DHS published monthly border apprehension numbers showing an uptick, often asking her why the government couldn’t detain undocumented minors indefinitely. Because that, Nielsen would calmly explain, would be illegal.

By last November, the constant friction with a president who struggled to grasp the complexities of immigration law had driven Nielsen to the brink of losing her job. White House allies placed bets on when she would be fired — by cold-blooded tweet, many expected — even before Trump told Fox News that his DHS chief needed to “get much tougher” if she wished to remain in his Cabinet.

But in the four months since her dismissal seemed inevitable, Nielsen has engineered a remarkable comeback.

More than a dozen former and current administration officials and others close to Nielsen who spoke with POLITICO on the condition of anonymity described the DHS chief as a former dead woman walking whose unexpected survival has opened a new chapter for her management of a powerful cabinet department. Cabinet colleagues and Republican allies now describe her as a rising star, all the stronger for having survived Trump’s wrath. She has managed to forge a stable relationship with Trump and now spends at least as much one-on-one time with him as any other Cabinet secretary.

That, they say, is thanks to her skillful handling of Trump’s border wall fixation, as well as to the departure of former White House chief of staff John Kelly, whose close relationship with Nielsen often made her collateral damage in his frequent clashes with Trump and his senior advisers.

“Having General Kelly removed from the relationship has given her a more direct point to the president,” said a person close to Nielsen.

“Kirstjen is still standing strong as secretary because she gets results and doesn’t get distracted,” said Chad Sweet, a former DHS chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration.

Twice in recent weeks, Trump has approvingly told Nielsen she’s “got a big job,” leading her to feel as though he now understands the complexities of her position as well as her intentions, according to a close confidant.

As DHS prepares to start its move to a new campus in Southeast Washington next month, Nielsen has been spending time working from office space in the Reagan Building on Pennsylvania Avenue because of its close proximity to the White House and Capitol Hill. Though she was often summoned to the Oval Office during the 35-day government shutdown to work with Trump through the crisis du jour, her autonomy has also grown. Three people familiar with the plans said Nielsen, who recently traveled to El Salvador for meetings with Northern Triangle security ministers, has two more foreign trips on her calendar in the coming months, including another visit to Latin America.

Back at home, Nielsen has shuffled staff around strategic priorities at a department with sprawling responsibilities that extend well beyond the president’s pet obsession of immigration — including cyber security, and domestic counter-terrorism. To that end, she promoted Miles Taylor, formerly deputy chief of staff at the agency and a senior adviser to Kelly when he held Nielsen’s job, to serve as chief of staff after nominating his predecessor, Chad Wolf, to lead the agency’s internal policy shop, which one former DHS official said is “sorely” in need of leadership.

“Her bread-and-butter issue is cybersecurity and there’s a lot that remains to be done in terms of making sure the country is equipped to deal with that threat, so you can expect her to start talking about that more,” said the person close to Nielsen, adding that “she’s in this until she can feel like she’s accomplished what she wants.”

Another sign that Nielsen is hunkering down was her announcement this week of a terrorism prevention summit that DHS will host later this year. “Stay tuned!” she wrote in a tweet on Tuesday, advertising a gathering of “companies, countries, and other key stakeholders to counter terrorist recruitment and radicalization.”

People close to Nielsen say she’s resolved to remain in her position as long as possible, having finally shaken off distracting speculation about her job security. Being in the hot seat for so long brought Nielsen “past the point of giving a crap to please the president or anybody else at the White House,"" said a person close to her. But it also enabled her to cultivate strong bonds with officials inside the White House Domestic Policy Council and Office of Legislative Affairs, as well as with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump’s newest chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Nielsen’s advisers pushed her to “build some support internally” early on in her tenure, after realizing “that in order to survive in this environment” she would need allies who the president respected, according to a former DHS official.

One challenge for Nielsen will be restoring morale at a department whose employees have grown exasperated by Trump’s laser focus on illegal immigration, especially when White House officials would seek support from the agency’s front office, which one former senior administration official described as “not well run.” The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

“It’s frustrating because you’re getting hit from the outside, but you’re not empowered to do anything about it on the inside,” the former official said.

DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton said Nielsen “has always worked diligently to support the frontline operators” in the department, in addition to “working 24/7 to keep our country safe and lead the dedicated team members at DHS.”

“We are seeing the results of significant Department-wide efforts over the last 14 months to implement more of the President’s security-focused agenda — immigration enforcement regulations have been issued, election infrastructure has been secured, multiple major natural disasters have been effectively mitigated, terror plots have been thwarted, [Migrant Protection Protocol] has been implemented and new border wall is being built,” Houlton added in a statement to POLITICO.

Part of the reason Nielsen’s standing with Trump has improved so dramatically is that she’s adjusted her strategy both publicly and privately.

Nielsen began her job with the view “that somebody competent” needed to run DHS rather than letting Trump install a secretary far outside the mainstream, according to a former DHS official. She has since become a more comfortable and more visible advocate of the president’s agenda — vigorously defending the administration in TV appearances and regularly visiting the border — and has learned to present Trump with options instead of simply telling him his goals are infeasible.

One White House official credited her with developing a “Remain in Mexico” policy that requires asylum seekers to wait on the Mexican side of the border until their cases can be heard by American immigration judges, even as other Trump aides, including national security adviser John Bolton, told Trump he could do little to alter U.S. asylum practices.

“Just look at how she managed to get the Mexican government to agree to process asylum applicants on their side of the border,” added Sweet.

Others pointed to Trump’s recent embrace of steel border fencing, which he embraced after conversations with Nielsen and Border Patrol experts.

“She went in and was originally telling him, ‘No you can’t do this because it’s illegal’ … and he didn’t like hearing it,” said the former senior administration official. “And now I think she’s better at understanding how to speak to him in a way that he feels like he’s getting what he wants.”

Their improved rapport is a far cry from the tone Trump used at a Cabinet meeting last May, when he criticized Nielsen over a spike in illegal border crossings so harshly that she reportedly considered resigning. (Trump was “rightly frustrated” at the time, Nielsen later told the New York Times.) The president told friends less than four months later that he was thinking of installing someone new at DHS who would more enthusiastically implement his agenda.

Some Nielsen allies now claim that the barrage of negative stories about her was “part of a very coordinated push to force her into a more aggressive immigration position,” as the former senior administration official put it.

""It took her awhile to hit her stride,"" said a former DHS official. ""But she's now living her life just fine in DC and everything has totally calmed down.""",2019,03,04,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/kirstjen-nielsen-donald-trump-wrath-1200602

(CNN) Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States, modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily.

Here's this week's briefing:

Several ongoing national security risks persist -- and they're coming from within the White House. The US government, including the intelligence community, relies on critical relationships with counterparts around the world when it comes to collecting and sharing information that helps keep Americans safe.

But these critical relationships are now growing increasingly strained as a result of President Donald Trump's highly questionable decisions and statements.

Just consider the last week. Despite the President's denials that he wasn't involved in Jared Kushner's security clearance process , reporting from The New York Times on Thursday indicates he played a critical role in securing Kushner's top-secret clearance -- over the objections of members of the intelligence community.

As if that didn't raise enough red flags, that same day Trump announced in Hanoi that he was taking Kim Jong Un's word that he didn't know that Otto Warmbier, the American student arrested in North Korea in 2016, endured alleged abuse and torture during his 17 months in prison.

And just this weekend Trump continued his attacks on critical American institutions, including the FBI and the free press, at CPAC.

In taking these actions, the President is undermining relationships that are crucial to our national security, since our partners are probably increasingly worried about how any information they share with us will be used. As a result, foreign intelligence agencies that have historically cooperated with the US may question how to engage with us going forward if they think the information they're offering is only going to be disputed or ignored. Worse yet, they may choose to withhold information if they think members of the White House cannot responsibly handle it.

But let's dive a bit deeper.

The Kushner risk factor

Jared Kushner is probably the number one draft pick for foreigners trying to manipulate US policy or gain access to sensitive information. Kushner has access, influence and some combination of inexperience and hubris -- qualities that make him a high-value target.

Not surprisingly, intelligence professionals, as well as the White House counsel and chief of staff, did not think that Kushner should receive top secret clearance, according to The New York Times . But the President reportedly overruled their concerns and ordered officials to give Kushner access to top secret information. (The White House said it would not comment on security clearances.)

It's not publicly clear exactly why intelligence experts recommended against giving him such a clearance, which grants certain government officials access to information whose unauthorized disclosure would cause exceptionally grave damage to our national security.

JUST WATCHED Intel officials warn about Trump's 'ignorance', TIME reports Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Intel officials warn about Trump's 'ignorance', TIME reports 01:42

But we do know that Kushner made various moves that are often viewed as counterintelligence red flags -- including his failure to disclose foreign contacts . Regardless, if US intelligence agents expressed a discomfort with him accessing this information, it is entirely logical for our foreign counterparts to worry that Kushner is not equipped to handle top secret intelligence responsibly.

Our intelligence partners -- whose own sources and methods turn into reports that are often integrated into assessments that Kushner is reading -- may scale back their work with us out of a fear that they will be caught in the cross hairs of the President's legally authorized but ill-advised decision to give Kushner top clearance.

The threats associated with Kushner's clearance are not just limited to his treatment of classified information. Because of his high level role at the White House, he often officially represents the US government and leads discussions on key issues, like Middle East peace talks and our relationships with China and Saudi Arabia

And there is reason to worry. According to media reports and former White House officials, Kushner has made a series of counterintelligence missteps during these meetings -- like failing to communicate via official channels and failing to prep with or debrief members of the White House team. This is especially worrisome because there are reports that foreign powers see him as easy to manipulate , including the Saudis whom he just met with.

Plus, When Kushner meets with foreign counterparts, they may have questions about how open to be with him, based on concerns about what he'll do with the information they share (including classified information), and whose interests he is representing, given potential conflicts of interest or counterintelligence manipulation points. This could lead foreign counterparts to censor what they say to him, which is a significant risk, considering Kushner is currently leading negotiations on several key issues.

If the President is not willing to fire Kushner, he should at least take steps to restrict Kushner's access to whatever information intelligence professionals think he cannot be trusted with.

Listening comprehension matters

After meeting with Kim in Hanoi, Trump said ""bad things"" had happened to Warmbier but said Kim was unaware of these things. The President's statement signaled that he either didn't prep with his intelligence experts, or he refused to listen to them. If he had, they would have likely told him that North Korea is a top-down, despotic police state. Little happens in North Korea without Kim's approval, especially not when it comes to the treatment of a high-value asset like an American hostage.

Even after the Warmbier family issued a heartbreaking statement in response to the President's kowtowing to Kim, the President did not retract his support for Kim but instead said his remarks were misinterpreted , which did not address the underlying issue regarding Kim's involvement.

Plus, US intelligence experts probably warned Trump that Kim would deny involvement. Taking Kim at his word will only embolden him and other leaders to feel like they can abuse and kill again, if the US President will not hold them accountable. And if the President doesn't value his own team's input ahead of a high-stakes summit -- especially when it comes to an issue like the torture of an American -- it sends an alarming message that the intelligence officials are being discounted in an area where they play an essential role.

Stop ticking through Putin's to-do list

The President's attacks on the building blocks of our democracy during his CPAC speech will likely fuel additional concerns that he isn't listening to his intelligence community at all. They have publicly flagged Russian President Vladimir Putin's objective to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order , along with US institutions and social cohesion . They have publicly stated that Russia aims to influence, demoralize and confuse us through disinformation operations.

It is probably hard for anyone to understand why the President would knowingly do things that hurt the US, while lending a helping hand to a foreign adversary. This, plus a record of similar moves that even led the Justice Department to open a counterintelligence investigation into the President , will add fuel to concerns that the President may be wittingly or unwittingly helping Russia.

And intelligence partners may be confused about why he would seemingly choose to say things that he thinks will score political points even though they help advance Russia's attack on the United States. This could further damage our relationships with key intelligence partners who are already questioning their own willingness to fully engage with the President.

If these risks grow, the American people will be the biggest loser. Without the benefit of full intelligence sharing with our global partners -- and the trust and candor from our foreign counterparts -- the President is hamstringing the home team's ability to protect the American people.",2019,03,03,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/03/opinions/presidential-weekly-briefing-kushner-problem-vinograd/index.html
cnbc,Robert Mueller notifies judge that Roger Stone shared Instagram image,"At the same Feb. 21 hearing, the judge warned him: ""Today, I gave you a second chance. This is not baseball, you don't get a third chance.""

If Jackson finds that Stone, who is currently free on a $250,000 signature bond, violated that order, she could have him jailed without bail pending his trial on charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing justice.

Stone on Sunday deleted the ""Who framed Roger Stone"" image from a series of other rotating images on his Instagram story shortly after CNBC sent an email to his lawyer asking about it.

The other images suggested that people donate to Stone's legal defense fund, with one saying, ""I am committed to proving my innocence. But I need your help,"" and another saying, ""I've always had Trump's back. Will you have mine?""

""We note for the Court that according to public reporting, on March 3, 2019, the defendant's Instagram account shared an image with the title 'who framed Roger Stone.' A copy of the image is submitted under seal as Exhibit C,"" Mueller said in the court filing in federal court in Washington, D.C.

CNBC's story on the image is referenced in a footnote in that filing.

Stone posted the ""Framed"" Instagram image two days after Jackson ordered his defense lawyers to explain why they did not tell her about the planned publication of a book by Stone that could violate her gag order. The book is entitled ""The Myth of Russian Collusion: The Inside Story of How Trump Really Won.""

Jackson's gag order prohibits Stone from ""making statements to the media or in public settings about the Special Counsel's investigation or this case or any of the participants in the investigation or the case.""

The gag covers ""posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other form of social media,"" as well as other forms of communication.

In his new book, The Washington Post reported Monday, Stone writes: ""I now find myself on Crooked Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's hit list because I have advised Donald Trump for the past forty years. I am being targeted not because I committed a crime, but because the Deep State liberals want to silence me and pressure me to testify against my good friend.""

Mueller's spokesman, who had declined to comment to CNBC on Stone's post Sunday, declined to comment Monday on the special counsel's filing Monday.

Stone's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier Monday, Stone's attorneys told Jackson in a filing that they believed his new book, which has an updated introduction discussing his case, should be allowed to be published because it was written and edited before the judge issued her gag order.

His attorneys write that Stone's publication of the book ""should not be viewed as contravening the Court's prohibitions because these prohibitions were not extant and could not have been known prior to February 21, 2019.""

But Mueller's filing afterward noted that, ""A preview of the defendant's book, including the updated Introduction referenced in the defendant's Motion to Clarify, is currently publicly available on Amazon.com and Google Books.""

Stone was arrested in January. He has pleaded not guilty in the case.

Mueller claims Stone lied to Congress about his alleged effort to get the document collection group WikiLeaks to release emails hacked by Russian agents from Democrats, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Stone is alleged to have been in contact with top-ranking Trump campaign officials about efforts to leak damaging information about Clinton.

bloomberg,Trump's New Attorney General Won't Recuse Himself in Mueller Probe,"LISTEN TO ARTICLE 2:24 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

Attorney General William Barr said he won’t recuse himself from being in charge of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, a major development affecting the fate of the politically charged probe into President Donald Trump.

“Following General Barr’s confirmation, senior career ethics officials advised that General Barr should not recuse himself from the special counsel’s investigation. Consistent with that advice, General Barr has decided not to recuse,” Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman.

Kupec confirmed that the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who intends to leave the department in the coming weeks, continues to be the primary liaison between the special counsel and Barr.

The question of whether Barr, who was confirmed as attorney general last month, should oversee Mueller has become a political flashpoint.

Under Justice Department regulations, the attorney general has sole authority over Mueller and has the power to decide how much of Mueller’s final report is provided to Congress and made public. With Mueller believed to be close to completing his work, Democrats in Congress are vowing to force the release of his report and the evidence underlying it.

The president repeatedly attacked and ridiculed his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself based on his role in Trump’s campaign. Trump removed Sessions in November and named Matthew Whitaker acting attorney general.

Whitaker, who had criticized Mueller’s investigation before joining the Justice Department, decided not to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation in December, even though a senior department ethics official said a formal review would likely recommend a recusal.

Whitaker never asked for a formal ethics recommendation. He and a small group of advisers decided there was no precedent for him to recuse under these circumstances. Whitaker left the Justice Department on March 2.

Earlier: Democrats Demand Mueller Full Disclosure, Citing GOP’s Precedent

During his confirmation hearing in January, Barr refused to say whether he’d recuse himself from overseeing Mueller. He said that he would consult with career Justice Department officials on the recusal matter, but the decision would ultimately be his to make.

Critics questioned Barr’s ability to be in charge of Mueller because he sent an unsolicited memo to White House lawyers last year criticizing the special counsel for looking into Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey as possible obstruction of justice.

Barr also revealed during his confirmation hearing that he spoke to Trump about Mueller and his probe in 2017, when Trump was looking for personal legal representation.",2019,03,04,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-04/trump-s-attorney-general-won-t-recuse-himself-in-mueller-probe

foxnews,"New York Times backs up Trump's migrant claim after WaPo ridiculed it : ‘Yes, there was duct tape’","The Washington Post was among many news organizations to denounce President Trump’s claim of tape being used to silence women during illegal border crossings — but a subsequent New York Times article revealed the president wasn’t making things up after all.

Back on Jan. 25, the Post published an update to a piece headlined, “Trump again mentioned taped-up women at the border. Experts don’t know what he is talking about.” It claimed the president’s ""new favorite anecdote"" was about tape covering the mouths of migrant women.

‘MORNING JOE’ MAINSTAY CLAIMS TRUMP COULD START A CIVIL WAR: ‘I'M NOT SPEAKING HYPERBOLE’

Post reporter Katie Mettler wrote that Trump, in pushing for a border wall, was claiming “without evidence that traffickers tie up and silence women with tape” before illegally crossing the border. The Post called Trump’s claims “salacious and graphic,” even providing a timeline of Trump’s taped-women rhetoric.

“Yet human-trafficking experts and advocates for immigrant women have said they are perplexed by this increasingly repeated story in Trump’s repertoire — and are at a loss for where he got his information. It was not from them, they say; in fact, they have no idea what he is talking about,” Mettler wrote.

Not so fast. Last week, The New York Times published a piece headlined, “Yes, there was duct tape: The harrowing journeys of migrants across the border.” The piece – part of a limited-run series on border crossing – reveals that tape is used during border crossings.

WASHINGTON POST FINALLY COVERS BERKELEY ASSAULT ON CONSERVATIVE, FOCUSES ON RESPONSE FROM RIGHT

The Times report said that women are “tied up” and “bound,” featuring first-hand accounts from several women who experienced the brutality themselves.

“For weeks, President Trump has been criticized for exaggerating the brutality experienced by migrant women on the border as he makes his case for a wall,” the Times wrote. “But there is some truth to the president’s descriptions of the threat of sexual assault and of women who have been duct-taped and bound.”

Trump often refers to the Times as “failing,” and the paper made sure to note that Trump may have been “exaggerating” before backing up his core claim.

“Undocumented women have been duct-taped and tied up before, during and after their migration to the United States, The Times discovered while reporting a story that will soon be published. Maybe not frequently, but it has happened,” the Times wrote.

But it was only a month prior that the Post brought in experts who claimed that Trump’s comments were “completely divorced from reality.”

“It’s clear that he just doesn’t have an understanding of what happens at the border,” an executive from an immigration legal services and advocacy nonprofit told the paper.

The Post attempted to debunk Trump’s claim while slipping in the disclaimer that experts “did not rule out the possibility that there are female trafficking victims near the border who have been bound or gagged.”

TRUMP SCOLDS CNN’S JIM ACOSTA, AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORTER IN ROSE GARDEN: ‘YOU HAVE AN AGENDA’

The Washington Post did not answer directly when asked if a correction or editor’s note would be added to its piece that declared experts are unaware of tape being used during border crossings. A spokeswoman, however, noted that the Times story reported that trafficking experts told the media they had not heard of such incidents, ""as reflected in The Post’s Jan. 25 story headline.""

The Post is hardly the only news organization that didn’t find the use of duct tape to be realistic.

Trump’s critics speculated that the president might be simply making things up or even stealing plotlines from the film “Sicario: Day of the Soldado.” The Toronto Star has also tried to debunk the duct-tape claims, once noting that “six trafficking experts” hadn’t heard what the president described.

CNN called Trump’s duct tape story “misleading,"" Daily Kos called it a “weird fantasy,” while ABC News wrote that the “Hollywood movie-style descriptions… are closer to fiction than fact.”

“I cooperate all the time with everybody and you know the beautiful thing, no collusion. It’s all a hoax,” President Trump responded while hosting the FCS national champion North Dakota State Bison football team Monday.

cnn,Trump again dares courts to stop him,"Washington (CNN) The legal confrontation over Donald Trump's immigration national emergency is becoming the most important test yet of his vision of an unfettered presidency immune to norms that check executive power.

The President hit back Tuesday after 16 states filed a lawsuit to stop his declaration aimed at redirecting funds already allocated by Congress for different purposes to build his border wall. The structure was the ideological anchor of his campaigns, rooted in claims that an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants and criminals is swamping America.

""As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, of course, the 9th Circuit! California, the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge!"" Trump tweeted.

The new legal fight has revived questions about Trump's expansive view of his own power and his frequent attempts to evade legal, political and constitutional restraints on his actions that add up to a more untethered notion of the presidency than most of his modern predecessors.

A profound question when Trump entered the Oval Office was whether his unruly, improvisational nature would be tamed by the magnitude of his new responsibilities and codes of presidential behavior framed over more than two centuries.

Or would Trump, a rambunctious, ego-driven outsider who never follows the rules, change the office itself by establishing precedents that his successors would eventually use to justify their own flexing of presidential power?

It's too early to assess Trump's long-term impact on the office of the presidency, a judgment that will be shaped by how his rule ends, after one or two terms, and the final conclusions of the Russia investigation.

But two tumultuous years, and six consequential weeks early in 2019 , suggest that many of the normal codes and conventions that governed the presidency for decades are suspended in the time of Trump.

He has lived up to his promise to his voters to disrupt the Washington establishment and the Western global consensus. Now, thwarted by a new Democratic House and the arcane checks and balances of the Senate, Trump is claiming new executive power to reconcile his hardline vows on immigration.

Trump's declaration of a national emergency to fund his border wall represents one of the boldest grabs for presidential authority in generations and caps what is now a lengthening record of contempt for the regular political order.

His straining against norms is not confined to his duels with Congress.

Trump's verbal torching of the institutions of his own government like the Justice Department and the FBI appears to be becoming more intense as Robert Mueller's special counsel probe grinds on.

One of Trump's most enduring strategies is his willingness to stake out easily disprovable positions if they support his political goals -- another way that he is unencumbered by the constraints of many of his predecessors. In a new manifestation of his resistance to objective fact, he is now openly trashing the data collected by his own agencies when it doesn't support his hunches on what he claims is an ""invasion"" of undocumented migrants.

He's even insisting he's already building his border wall -- reflecting the potential political price he may pay for failing to honor his top 2016 promise.

""I use many stats. I use many stats,"" Trump told a reporter who challenged him with official government data on drug trafficking last week. ""Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.""

Awkward silence

Trump's assault on the international system -- a step no President since the end of World War II would have dreamed of taking -- is widening. He's undoing trade deals, nuclear pacts and pressuring estranged alliances that underpin decades of US power in pursuit of his ""America First"" creed.

Europe's feelings were summed up by the stony, embarrassing silence when Vice President Mike Pence brought greetings from Trump to an annual national security conference in Munich over the weekend.

In his jarring news conference on Friday, Trump blasted away at the institutions that mold a free society -- including constitutional principles, the freedom of the press and the independent judiciary. He even publicly envied China's record on extra-judicial executions in an open rebuke of traditional US values.

And Trump has several times , that we know about, prized the counsel of Russian President Vladimir Putin over that of his own spy chiefs. He bristles when he's challenged on his world view as the roster of ex-administration officials shows.

One Trump ally, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Monday that the buzz around the White House is that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats may be in danger after contradicting Trump's national security policies in a recent congressional hearing.

""There's a feeling that maybe there needs to be a change of leadership in that position,"" Ruddy said.

If Trump sacks Coats for insubordination, it will be a fresh example of how the President appears more untethered from personal, political and behavioral guardrails than any commander in chief in modern history.

Trump's coming second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears as much motivated by his personal desire for a political win -- or a Nobel peace prize -- as any sign that their first meeting made much progress towards denuclearization.

His administration, which has shed staff at a historic clip, now looks more and more like the top-down, family business staffed by loyal retainers that characterized his real estate empire.

As his trampling of Republican anxiety about a national emergency showed last week, Trump's not much worried about putting his own party in unpleasant political spots.

His emergency declaration is in itself an expression of contempt for congressional power and is different than previous emergency declarations since he plans to spend money already allocated by lawmakers for other purposes to build a wall they refused to fund.

And Trump, who once said he knew more about ISIS than his generals, is not partial to military advice that contradicts his own views -- such as the Syria withdrawal plan that has alarmed top military commanders.

Trump's explanation for choosing a national emergency last week to build his wall might have undermined his legal case for bypassing Congress in what may be a new effort by the courts -- one of the few roadblocks to Trump during his first two years in office -- to frustrate the President.

But his remark was revealing about a presidency rooted as much in personal gratification and a desire to spark outrage as a long-term ideological program.

""I wanted to do it faster. I could do the wall over a longer period of time, I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster,"" the President said.

Other presidents have declared national emergencies. Some, such as Richard Nixon, have been erratic and incoherent in public. Franklin D. Roosevelt, seen as one of history's best presidents, made ambitious power grabs. Barack Obama dodged Congress with his ""pen-and-phone"" strategy of executive orders. Theodore Roosevelt made the presidency an extension of his boisterous and restless temperament. Andrew Jackson harnessed the power of flaming populism and Trump has professed to admire Old Hickory.

But it's hard to find a historical precedent for a commander in chief as volatile, publicly egotistical and apparently oblivious to constitutional norms as Trump.

Now that most of the restraining influences -- like James Mattis, the former defense secretary, or Rex Tillerson, the ex-secretary of state -- have left the administration, there are few internal limitations on Trump.

""Donald Trump doesn't have a containment vessel,"" said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University. ""It is a perfect storm for the presidency.""

For Trump's critics, America is heading down a dangerous autocratic path: It hardly seems likely that the President, with a taste for going it alone on a national emergency, will rein himself in.

Yet the fact that Trump, despite never cracking a 50% approval rating in most polls, remains a viable political force and may have a route to re-election, suggests that a substantial block of millions of Americans like what they see.

To Trump voters, the President is hacking away at a political system and governing structure they have come to believe does not represent them, after long years of economic hardship and endless foreign wars.

His complaints that foreign nations are bleeding the US dry are popular among voters tired of foreign engagements -- a feeling that is also traceable in the Democratic base as the 2020 campaign begins.

Trump's relentless base-pleasing strategy has intimidated his fellow Republicans, further loosening checks on a presidency that until recently benefited from a pliant Congress dominated by the GOP.

Republicans, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, appear to have concluded that the way to avoid a primary fight is to embrace Trump -- testimony to the power of the President with the base.

""When the leader says do something, there's become the tendency to do it,"" former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, now a senior CNN political commentator, said on ""New Day"" on Monday.

""There has been more allegiance to the leader than I am sort of used to,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""When I was in Congress there were times when we just told the leadership, 'We don't agree with you and we are going to do what we have to do.'""

Still, it's likely that some Republicans will peel away from the President when a resolution to terminate his state of emergency comes up in both chambers, though few observers predict a veto-proof majority.

Relying exclusively on a vocal, if engaged, minority will pose complications for Trump's re-election hopes.

And the fact there will be debate on the state of emergency at all suggests that from now on -- with Democrats running the House -- Trump will not have things all his own way, especially as a new oversight operation by committee chairs gears up.

""We have got to keep in mind that not every institution has been Trumpified,"" said Naftali. ""The American people went to the polls in November and they voted in a Democratic majority in the House.

One of the President's top policy advisers, Stephen Miller, on Sunday indicated that Trump would cast the first veto of his presidency to defend the highly contentious declaration if lawmakers seek to terminate it.

Democrats argued that Trump had launched an unconstitutional power grab because Congress refused to grant his request for billions of dollars in wall funding, and he decided to fund it anyway with money appropriated for other purposes including military construction projects.

And California's Attorney General Xavier Becerra promised to ""definitely and imminently"" launch a legal challenge to the emergency declaration, one of an expected flurry of suits against Trump's aggressive executive power move.

Trump's announcement, made during a rambling news conference Friday, came after he admitted defeat in his bid to get Congress to pay $5.7 billion in wall funding, but avoided triggering a second government shutdown.

During that event, the President appeared to undermine his own arguments in several ways by saying he ""didn't need"" to declare the emergency but wanted to go faster than Congress on border security.

Miller tried to clean up that remark in an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""What the President was saying is, is that unlike past presidents, he could choose to ignore this crisis, choose to ignore this emergency as others have, but that's not what he's going to do,"" Miller said.

The senior adviser, one of the most hardline voices on immigration in the White House, also made clear that if Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiates an effort to wipe out the declaration, using a clause in the National Emergencies Act of 1976, Trump would respond.

""He's going to protect his national emergency declaration, guaranteed,"" Miller said.

Congress should 'take back power'

Once the House acts, Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell is unlikely to be able to prevent a termination effort from coming to the floor, and given skepticism among some Republicans, it's possible a majority could be assembled against Trump's gambit even in the Senate.

Republican Rep. Will Hurd, who represents a vast district along the southern border in Texas, said he would back a measure in the House that prevents Trump taking money away from military construction projects for the wall.

""I'm always open to making sure that Congress takes back some of this power as a co-equal branch of government. And I'm sure there's going to be a lot of conversations,"" Hurd said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" on CBS.

But one of the President's closest congressional allies, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, predicted that Trump's critics would not be able to put together a two-thirds majority in each chamber of Congress to override any presidential veto.

""I think there are plenty of votes in the House to make sure that there is no override of the President's veto. So it's going to be settled in court,"" Jordan said Sunday on ABC News ""This Week.""

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson expressed concern about Trump's claim of authority to act on the wall — which some of his colleagues have warned could establish a precedent for a future Democratic president to take aggressive executive action on an issue like climate change or gun control.

""I wish he wouldn't use it in this case,"" Johnson told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday and warned that a ""diminished"" Congress had ceded power to the presidency and the courts.

But the Wisconsin senator also appeared to offer himself an out from voting against Trump's assertion of power, suggesting there is a good chance that the GOP will, as is often the case, decline to constrain its president.

""We're going to take a very careful look at what he's doing here in this instance,"" Johnson said. ""But, again, I have to stress this president's been thwarted in his attempt to keep this nation safe and secure. To secure our borders.

""Let's face it, if this president can claim a mandate on anything he ran on, it's exactly this issue: better barriers and securing our border.""

While polls show a majority of Americans oppose the wall and don't support a declaration of national emergency to fund it , a CNN/SSRS survey released this month showed that 64% of Republicans do support a national emergency to get a wall and 72% of conservative GOPers back it.

Hard to image a 'poorer case'

Democrats sought to portray Trump's action as a gross abuse of power, arguing that it differs from emergency declarations by previous presidents and could reshape the relationship between the executive and Congress.

""This is the first time a President has tried to declare an emergency when Congress explicitly rejected funding for the particular project that the president is advocating,"" House Democratic Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday.

""If we surrender the power of the purse, which is our most important power, there will be little check and no balance left. It will not be a separation of powers anymore, just a separation of parties. So this is going to be a moment of truth for my GOP colleagues.""

Another Democrat, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, resorted to humor to mock Trump's use of executive power.

""Day 3 of Emergency. Checking in from Oahu. Light rain, 66 degrees. Be careful out there,"" Schatz wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

On a more serious note, Becerra said that the California court challenge would use Trump's own remarks to undermine his declaration and would argue that he has created an artificial emergency that does not meet historic standards of such declarations.

""We are prepared, we knew something like this might happen. And with our sister state partners, we are ready to go,"" said Becerra on ABC's ""This Week.""

""There is enough evidence to show that this is not the 9/11 crisis that we faced back in 2001, it's not the Iran hostage crisis we faced in 1979,"" Becerra said.

""It's not even the type of national emergency where we are trying to take action against a foreign enemy or to avoid some type of harm befalling Americans abroad.""

Trump is unrepentant. An emergency declaration in many ways is a neat political device that allows him to move on from his defeats in Congress over the wall. Even if his declaration is blocked by the courts, it will give him a crusade with which he can rally his base in his 2020 re-election fight.

In a sing-song refrain, Trump said Friday that he believed his effort would be quickly rejected in court but seemed to pin his hopes on an eventual favorable ruling in the Supreme Court with its new conservative majority.

Until then, Trump is insisting, without evidence, that he is getting on with fulfilling the campaign promise that lit a fire under his 2016 campaign — and which he seems to be betting could deliver him a second term.

washingtonpost,The 6 essential cons that define Trump’s success,"

Jonathan Greenberg is an investigative financial and legal journalist and author.

Nearly four decades ago, Donald Trump deceived me into including him on the first Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. He claimed a net worth of $100 million but was actually worth less than a tenth of that. Last week, President Trump declared a national state of emergency to bypass the constitutional budgeting powers of Congress and divert money to build a wall on the border with Mexico. What do these acts have in common? Only that they are the first and latest entries on the continuum of cons that have defined Trump’s success.

A real estate insider told me back in the 1980s that Trump’s win-at-all-costs father, Fred, “loves a crook and he loves a showman.” Donald Trump has built his extraordinary career by exhibiting the characteristics of both. He is a self-promoter willing to lie, swindle and destroy to advance his insatiable self-interest. I am not the first journalist to observe that for Trump, the “Art of the Deal” has been the art of the con. But as the first journalist to enable the consummate con man’s career-boosting deceptions, I have a completist’s view of the pernicious racket that is his playbook. Here, in roughly chronological order, are the six essential cons around which Trump has built and sustained his success:

Con No. 1: To borrow billions, Trump lies to inflate his net worth.

As Trump’s power has grown, his lies have become bolder and more apparent. Early in his career, however, when Trump first conned me into putting him on the Forbes 400 list and then deceived financial institutions to loan him billions of dollars based upon a vastly exaggerated net worth, his deceptions were more elaborate and difficult to track. As recounted in The Washington Post last year, Trump fed me carefully crafted false information for years. This included two long phone interviews in which Trump pretended to be a nonexistent assistant named John Barron, as well as his having his notorious fixer Roy Cohn call me at Forbes in 1982 and 1983 to lie on his behalf.

[Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400. Here are the tapes.]

Trump was consistent in maintaining the lies he told Forbes: that he controlled his father’s assets, that his family owned 25,000 apartments (they owned less than half that number), and that his projects had less debt and far more profits than they actually did — all facts and figures that were hard to challenge. Anyone who listens to the two 40-minute telephone recordings I made in 1984 of the man who Trump’s secretary said was the Trump Organization’s “VP of Finance John Barron” can easily recognize Trump’s thinly disguised voice. Some critics wondered how stupid I had been not to have seen through this ruse. Yet even the most seasoned journalist could not have imagined a prominent figure doing what nobody had, as far as I am aware, dared to do before or since: impersonate a nonexistent spokesman on the phone to national media.

The failure of our imagination to respond to Trump remains true to this day. It is not that we underestimate his capacity as a businessman, candidate or president of the United States. It is that we cannot imagine — and are unprepared to respond to — anyone who lies and cons as shamelessly and effectively as he does.

Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show” framed Trump’s Forbes 400 scam as his “origin lie,” the foundation he built his entire career on. That’s because, as Tim O’Brien wrote in his book “TrumpNation”: “The more often Forbes mentioned him, the more credible Donald’s claim to vast wealth became. … The more credible his claim to vast wealth became, the easier it was for him to get on the Forbes 400 — which became the standard that other media, and apparently some of the country’s biggest banks, used when judging Donald’s riches.”

It is hard to imagine that financial institutions would extend $3 billion in loans to Trump’s Atlantic City and New York real estate projects based on his inflated asset statements and Forbes 400 listing without insisting on audited financial statements that demonstrated exactly how much cumulative debt he was on the hook for. Yet during the eight years after he first conned his way onto the list, this appears to be exactly what happened. As with all great con men, Trump is as skilled in the art of deception as he is in the art of promotion. He made certain that nobody could definitively counter his inflated-wealth con by ensuring that a comprehensive balance sheet was never created. As The Post’s Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher wrote in their book “Trump Revealed,” Trump, in 1990, brought in Steve Bollenbach as chief financial officer to respond to lender concerns about his crippling debt. They report: “When Bollenbach began delving into the organization’s finances, he got a surprise. The small staff on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower included three accountants. Each knew about pieces of the fraying empire — the casinos, for instance, or the condos. But no one knew the overall picture; there were no consolidated financial reports.”

This was deliberate. And despite multiple bankruptcies, Trump’s inflated-worth ruse remained at the center of his image as a successful businessman, a billionaire able to play the part of a brilliant tycoon on “The Apprentice” reality show and capable of licensing his name for millions of dollars.

Although Trump has threatened to sue reporters many times, the only time he followed through with a libel suit was in 2006, after O’Brien, in “TrumpNation,” reported that three experts close to Trump believed his true net worth to be between $150 million and $250 million — far from the $6 billion he claimed he was worth at the time.

Trump lost the suit, appealed the ruling, then lost the appeal in 2011. This was the same year he again demonstrated how important his illusory billionaire status was to him. As noted in “Trump Revealed,” while cooperating with a Comedy Central “roast” of him, Trump insisted that the show’s comedians agree to keep only one subject off-limits. “Don’t say I have less money than I say I do,” Trump insisted, according to comedian Anthony Jeselnik. “Make fun of my kids, do whatever you want. Just don’t say that I don’t have that much money.”

Con No. 2: To avoid taxes, Trump lies to deflate his net worth.

The only people Trump ever wanted to convince that he had less money than he did were those who worked for the Internal Revenue Service. And somehow, despite his inflated public claims of income and valuations, he managed to do just that. Last year, the New York Times published the results of a painstakingly researched investigation into Trump’s tax dodges. The article stated: “President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents … He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents … He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents’ real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings. … The president’s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.” Instead, the Times reported, “the Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent.”

Virtually every aspect of the Trump family empire operated like a tax evasion scheme. According to the Times, over the years, 295 separate revenue streams were created for Fred Trump to evade gift and income taxes while directing money to his children.

Donald Trump not only managed to deflate the value of his family’s assets for tax purposes, but in a con that probably goes unrivaled in American tax-dodging history, from at least 1996 onward, he reportedly erased personal income taxes he would have otherwise paid from profitable ventures like his “Apprentice” TV show. How? He used the whopping $916 million loss of the money that had come from the lenders who had backed his casinos. Over the next 15 years, Trump was able to pay no income taxes on this loss of $916 million in other people’s money.

[I sold Trump $100,000 worth of pianos. Then he stiffed me.]

But Trump has not been content with schemes to avoid federal government and state tax collectors. The undervaluation con continues full throttle as he evades local real estate taxes on his golf courses. As The Post pointed out in an investigation in 2016, Trump’s attorneys audaciously deflate the value of his many golf courses to minimize local taxes. In his financial disclosures for the Trump National Golf Course Westchester, The Post reported, “Trump valued the course at more than $50 million. But last year, his attorneys filed papers with the state declaring the ‘full market value’ of the course was far lower: about $1.4 million.” Trump has also been the king of tax-break litigation, suing the city of New York time and time again to take advantage of tax abatements that were never meant to apply to the type of luxury developments he built. Veteran New York Times real estate reporter Charles Bagli added up the staggering value of these tax dodges in a Times investigation titled, “A Trump Empire Built on Inside Connections and $885 Million in Tax Breaks.”

During a 2016 presidential debate, when challenged by Hillary Clinton to explain why he refused to disclose his taxes and why he paid no taxes on hundreds of millions in income, Trump replied, “That makes me smart.”

Con No. 3: To be a winner, Trump makes losers of those he does business with.

To make every business deal with him sound sweeter than it was, Trump marketed his name as synonymous with gold-plated luxury. But few of his deals had happy endings. His narcissistic need to be a winner every time meant that there were losers every time. This included just about anyone who made the mistake of signing a contract to lend or partner or supply goods or services to him. After stiffing his partners and lenders in Atlantic City in 1991 by declaring bankruptcy and forcing them to write down billions of dollars in losses, Trump soon retook control of the properties by creating a public casino company in 1995 and selling the stock to suckers attracted to his name. According to a MarketWatch columnist, “Donald Trump was a stock market disaster,” with Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts racking up more than $1 billion in losses during his 13 years as chairman, while its stock fell from a high of $35 to just 17 cents. But despite making losers of the poor saps who invested with him, Trump emerged a winner, soaking the bankrupted public company for what Fortune magazine estimated was $82 million in compensation.

Trump has bragged: “Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump? I’m like a PhD in litigation.” Unlike all the other things Trump says he knows more about than anybody, this one has a morsel of truth to it. While most Americans expect to do what they promise in a signed contract, Trump sees contracts as mere jumping-off points for “negotiation.” Knowing that litigation is costly and can drag on for years, Trump’s business modus operandi for stiffed contractors has been, “You can negotiate with my lawyers for a settlement or sue me and see how long that takes!” An analysis by USA Today published in June 2016 found that during the previous 30 years, Trump and his businesses have been involved in 3,500 state and federal legal cases.

Understanding special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation and Trump’s long relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia begins with recognizing that Trump has among the worst reputations of any businessperson in America. As investigative journalist Craig Unger explained in “House of Trump, House of Putin,” after burning so many major financial institutions by losing more than $3 billion in Atlantic City and overpriced New York properties, Putin’s “oligarchs and Mafia kingpins” were some of the only investors willing to do business with Trump, through untraceable offshore entities. Unger wrote that Trump’s real estate was “used as a vehicle that likely served to launder enormous amounts of money — perhaps billions of dollars — for the Russian Mafia for more than three decades.”

It is no coincidence that the only major financial institution willing to provide Trump with significant funding after his bankruptcies has been Deutsche Bank, which itself has been the source of fines and investigations related to billions of dollars in transactions by money-laundering clients, including Russian oligarchs.

Russian oligarchs were not the only money launderers to fund Trump’s properties. Global Witness, a nonprofit watchdog organization, headlined a scathing exposé a few years ago: “Narco-a-Lago: Money laundering at the Trump Ocean Club in Panama.”

[I study liars. I’ve never seen one like President Trump.]

The report found that many of the presold apartments in the 70-floor Panama City tower were funded by money launderers, including Colombian cocaine cartel members. Reuters reported that, “By the time the Trump Ocean Club project was complete in 2011, many investors had withdrawn and lost their deposits rather than stump up the 70 percent balance. Bondholders lost, too … There was one person who still profited: Donald Trump. Court records … indicate Trump … earned between $30 million and $50 million from lending his name to the project.”

Con No. 4: To win in politics, Trump makes voters believe that his presidency benefits them.

One of the great mysteries of Trump’s ascension to power is his support among working-class Americans. He is far from being a person who mingles with the masses. Trump’s social and professional activities have been limited to those who are superwealthy, famous or influential. To the extent that he has interacted with common Americans, it has been as a commercial icon: He sells them chances to lose money at his casinos’ slot machines; he grants them admission to real estate society through the scam that was Trump University; he offers them armchair viewing of crass demonstrations of cruel power in “The Apprentice.”

As part of candidate Trump’s campaign to attract working-class Americans to vote against their economic self-interest, Trump bragged that he was “very highly educated … I have the best words,” while continually railing against those he calls “the three most dangerous voices in America: academic elites, political elites and media elites.” He is easily the most successful anti-government populist to have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It is no coincidence that at the same time, he is a prolific liar.

Accepting Trump’s endless deceits have become articles of faith to any number of the 64 million Americans who, in 2016, were led to believe that his election would benefit them and their families. That Trump frequently lies about something he himself has been recorded saying in the recent past makes no difference to his base. Although the “Make America Great Again” prosperity he promises is available only for those who are part of the club of ultrawealthy elites on whose behalf he legislates, Trump supporters willfully listen only to their leader’s words instead of his actions in office.

As Trump’s supporters march toward an illusory future with their hate-mongering leader, they remain oblivious to the trillions of dollars that Trump’s tax cuts for the top 1 percent and their corporations will add to the federal debt, or to the forecasts of diminished spending on programs that help most working and middle-class Americans.

Trump told a Missouri audience in November 2017 that his tax bill was created to help the middle class and that it “is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me.” In reality, most of the long-term tax savings will go to major corporations and the superwealthy. According to a Forbes estimate, Trump could personally save $11 million annually. Yet his base of working- and middle-class supporters remains blind to the fact that Trump is making America great for himself and not them.

[Trump’s emergency declaration doesn’t show his power. It shows his weakness.]

That Trump’s lies are believed by so many is a testament to his manipulative mastery of the art of the con. In supporting his wall on the border with Mexico, Trump says that more than 3,000 terrorists were apprehended at the southern border. Yet our government’s own statistics show that the number was zero. Zero! Trump promised that Mexicans would pay for the wall again and again, then denied that he had ever said it and shut down the federal government because Congress refused to pay for it. Trump has even scammed his followers out of core Judeo-Christian values such as compassion. Thousands of children will suffer lifelong trauma because they are being separated from their parents as a result of Trump’s “zero tolerance” border policy. When I asked a white, 82-year-old Trump-supporting Floridian grandmother how she supported this policy given her Christian faith, her face seethed with anger: “It’s their parents’ fault for bringing them!”

Scapegoating foreigners for political gain is as old and tragically effective a tactic as appealing to racism. It is the same hatemongering tune that stirs disempowered working-class white people to blame African Americans for their economic challenges. As President Lyndon Johnson said to his young aide Bill Moyers in 1960: “If you can convince the lowest white man he’s better than the best colored man, he won’t notice you’re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he’ll empty his pockets for you.”

Con No. 5: To avoid accountability, Trump makes the media, and truth, the “enemy of the people.”

Truth is the greatest threat to Donald Trump. He despises the transparency and accountability that flows from a free press. He continually attacks the media as “the enemy of the people,” despite increasing violence against journalists by some of his supporters, repeating the phrase in a Wednesday tweet in reference to the Times. Gabriel Sherman, national affairs editor at New York magazine, described Trump’s use of this term as “full-on dictator speak.” For opponents of Joseph Stalin, being branded an enemy of the people was a death sentence. In Nazi Germany, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels also favored the term, arguing in 1941 that “each Jew is a sworn enemy of the German people.”

In an interview on Sept. 6, 2018, Trump responded to a critical Times editorial by stating, “The Times should never have done that, because really what they’ve done is, virtually, you know it’s treason.”

Trump regularly insults or threatens to sue journalists who refuse to act as stenographers for his lies. “It’s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write. And people should look into it,” he said, referring to NBC News on Oct. 11, 2017. “Network news,” he tweeted that day, “has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.” This prompted Sen. John McCain to note that the comment was “how dictators get started.”

Repeat a lie often enough, the saying goes, and it takes root as the truth. The Post has documented (and updates each day) every “false or merely misleading” claim that Trump has made since his election, and found that the president has lied more than 8,700 times. The rate of reckless falsehoods uttered per day has accelerated with his time in office — and with the convictions of his associates stemming from the Mueller investigation.

With the help of Fox News, Trump’s relentless deceptions have been successful in attracting and maintaining his core supporters. Trump boasted about the power of the deception of his Fox News-misinformed supporter base when he said, on the campaign trail, “I love the poorly educated,” and also, famously, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose voters.”

In his cautionary short handbook, “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons From the Twentieth Century,” Yale history professor Timothy Snyder identifies core components of fascism that are echoed in Trump’s ability to win and sustain the support of his political base. Snyder reflects on the extraordinary diaries of Victor Klemperer, a professor who survived Hitler and lived to write the tale. “Once truth had become oracular rather than factual, evidence was irrelevant,” Snyder wrote. “At the end of the war, a worker told Klemperer that ‘understanding is useless, you have to have faith. I believe in the Fuhrer.’ ”

Post columnist Greg Sargent believes that Trump’s war on the truth is worse than simple self-aggrandizement. “When Trump insists on his own invented ‘facts,’ ” Sargent wrote, “he makes reality-based political dialogue impossible. His utter disregard for truth is a subversion of our democracy and a dereliction of his duty as president.”

“Fascists,” Snyder writes, “despised the small truths of daily existence, loved slogans that resonated like a new religion, and preferred creative myths to history or journalism. They used new media, which at the time was radio, to create a drumbeat of propaganda that aroused feelings before people had time to ascertain facts. And now, as then, many people confused faith in a hugely flawed leader with the truth about the world we all share. … Post-truth is pre-fascism.”

Con No. 6: To stoke fear, Trump recasts perpetrators as victims.

As president, Trump’s primary governance strategy relies on the same deceptive manipulation of human fear that brought him victory as a candidate. He has proved himself masterful at playing the white Christian male grievance card. Whether it is the foreigners streaming across the border to take American jobs, the dark-skinned urbanites coming for rural Americans’ guns or empowered women upending patriarchal traditions, Trump and his Fox News echo chamber let white Christians know that they are being victimized and that far worse will follow if they do not fight for their right to oppress others.

A few months before the 2016 election, Molly Ball published an extraordinary article in the Atlantic predicting how Trump could use fear to win. “Ratcheting up fear,” Ball wrote, “helps Trump. … The fear reaction is a universal one to which everyone is susceptible … fear makes them cower from the unfamiliar and seek refuge and comfort. Trump channels people’s anger, but he salves their fear with promises of protection, toughness, strength. It is a feedback loop: He stirs up people’s latent fears, then offers himself as the only solution.”

Ball quoted a top Republican admaker who explained: “Fear is the simplest emotion to tweak in a campaign ad. You associate your opponent with terror, with fear, with crime, with causing pain and uncertainty.” Trump’s argument for building the wall with Mexico, even at the cost of the largest-ever abuse of the doctrine of eminent domain to seize private property, has no basis in rational analysis. All it has going for it is the con man’s relentless playing of the fear card.

“The Democrats,” Trump warned last October, “will open our borders to deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. The Democrats — and I say this — and I've dealt with it — the Democrats are the party of crime.”

Nazi leader Hermann Göring once said: “The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.”

Blaming the victim also works for sexual assault. At least 22 women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Trump has denied every accusation, proclaiming that these “false allegations” were made by “women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.” At a 2016 campaign rally, he told his supporters who the real victim was. “Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,” Trump said. “Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.”

When it came time to rescue his controversial choice of Brett M. Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice, Trump repeated the perpetrator-as-victim strategy that had worked so well for him. Bill Shine, Trump’s recently hired deputy chief of staff for communications, was just the right man for the job. Until being forced out of Fox News in 2017, Shine was the right-hand man of Fox CEO and alleged sexual predator Roger Ailes. There, as Vox observed, Shine was “a man with 20 years of experience enabling and covering up rampant sexual harassment, assault, and abuse.” After coaching sessions orchestrated by the White House, Kavanaugh appeared in an exclusive interview on Fox News arguing what the writer Jacob Weindling of Paste termed “the Bill O’Reilly defense,” the “standard Fox News sexual harassment playbook of denying everything while painting yourself as the victim.”

By the time Kavanaugh faced Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused him of sexual assault while they were in high school, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was arguing that her testimony was part of a “shameless smear campaign” by Democrats to destroy an innocent man’s life.

White Christian men are not the only victims in Trump’s imaginary world. America itself is being victimized — though not by the usual suspects. For more than 60 years, Republican Party voters and their leaders have been the most outspoken enemies of totalitarian Russia, denouncing nuclear disarmament while fanning the fires of murderous foreign wars to stop the expansion of Soviet influence. Now, quite suddenly, Trump has recast Putin, the most ruthless dictator to control Russia since the dark days of Stalin, into America’s friend, while denouncing NATO allies as freeloaders and America’s CIA and FBI as “deep state” enemies of the American people. Given Russia’s role in propping up his candidacy and real estate empire, it is easy to understand why Trump has done everything in his power to support Putin’s efforts to weaken the NATO alliance. What is tougher to understand are the self-identified conservatives and patriots who suddenly reversed a lifetime of political beliefs to suit the worldview of their corrupt leader. In George Orwell’s dystopian classic “1984,” the empire of Oceania is in an endless war with Eurasia. Then, without notice, in the middle of “Hate Week,” the all-powerful Party decides to join with its longtime enemy and be at war with Eastasia, its longtime ally. Once Big Brother makes known its decision, it becomes treason to disagree — or even to recall the past.

Trump’s seemingly limitless power over his core supporters allows him to justify even the most reprehensible behavior and manipulate their fear as he transforms friends into enemies and compassion into hatred. This power is as ominous as Big Brother’s.

Fear of a fascist future is what led me to write my new dystopian novel, “America 2034: Utopia Rising,” a spinoff of “1984” set in Trump’s nightmarish fifth term as President for Life. The story opens by describing how Trump declares his second state of emergency the day before the 2020 election, ordering a communications blackout to take control of polling places nationwide. This cautionary tale reflects what I fear may be Trump’s seventh, and most far-reaching, scam: conning Americans out of our democracy.",2019,02,22,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/02/22/essential-cons-that-define-trumps-success/
cnn,Donald Trump's plan for 2020 Democrats: Cause chaos and sow division,"Washington (CNN) One presidential candidate is following the Democratic primary fight far closer than you might imagine. His name is Donald J. Trump.

Inside the White House, the President is watching announcement rallies, tuning into televised town hall sessions with voters and listening carefully to commentary on the Democratic presidential race. His opinions fluctuate on who he will, or would like to, run against. But one sentiment is unwavering — he has no plans to sit idly by and watch.

The President intends to play an active role in the Democratic primary and has instructed his aides to look for ways he can, according to more than a dozen Republicans involved in his campaign. His team is working to sow divisions among rivals and looking for opportunities to ""cause chaos from the left and right,"" in the words of one adviser.

""The President wants to get into the game,"" said a top Republican who talks to Trump frequently, speaking on condition of anonymity to share a private conversation. ""People may knock him in terms of running the government, but he gets the campaign and can't wait to get started.""

Trump has been holding regular meetings with a small circle of advisers inside the White House, led by his 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, who briefs his boss often, sources say. On Tuesday, that meeting got a little bigger when Parscale sat down with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and more than a dozen aides to go over the expected structure of their campaign.

But a power struggle between the President's re-election campaign and those who helped him win the White House has already emerged.

Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, two central figures in the President's 2016 campaign, were not invited to the Tuesday meeting, amid a growing rivalry between Lewandowski and Parscale, according to people familiar with the matter. While Lewandowski and Bossie have the President's ear and were seen on the White House grounds the week before, they do not have a formal seat at the table.

""Brad Parscale is building a state of the art campaign operation, light years ahead of anything the Democrats have created. Our opponents are the Democrats, not anyone in the President's circle,"" said Kayleigh McEnany, a campaign spokeswoman, in a statement to CNN.

Another campaign official said Lewandowski and Bossie were not at the meeting because they're not on staff and that they will be invited to the campaign's meeting for surrogates soon.

Despite any early drama, aides say they hope the re-election effort will be a cohesive undertaking between the campaign, White House officials and the President's outside advisers. They believe it will require a massive and more coordinated strategy than the first time around, when Trump was seen as an unlikely winner.

In 2016, they won the White House on their own, without support or backup of the party apparatus. But now Trump is relying upon the help of the party establishment, which aides say has created an opening for tension among loyalists who helped him win the White House and those who surround him now.

Several former White House aides, including Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, have departed the West Wing for the campaign, which is coming to life only three miles from the White House. The desks are slowly filling inside Arlington Tower, where glass offices offer sweeping views of the Potomac River, the Jefferson Memorial and the capital Trump maligns.

Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, will also play a prominent role in the campaign, as he did in 2016, but he will do so from the West Wing, aides say. He speaks frequently to Parscale, who has secured his spot in the Trump family inner circle.

With a wide-open Democratic contest, where the ultimate winner of the nomination is literally a guessing game, the President and his advisers are trying to make the race anything but a referendum on him. Instead, they are trying to make it a choice between him and what they are trying to define as an out-of-touch Democratic alternative.

Trump telegraphed that during his State of the Union address, where he first laid bare his plan to brand the entire Democratic field as socialists. It's far from a new argument, but many Democrats acknowledge it could still be a potent one, which has led several candidates to suddenly voice their support for capitalism.

When Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont jumped into the race this week, the President and his advisers beamed, saying it fit perfectly into how they are trying to frame the race as a stark choice between Trump and socialism.

""It's a radical left -- a radical left,"" Trump said last week in the Oval Office.

But the President is watching far more than Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who he has repeatedly derided as ""Pocahontas.""

In recent days, Trump has also asked aides for political intelligence on former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. And he has wondered aloud about whether Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio could complicate Trump's chances in one of his favorite swing states if Brown decides to jump into the Democratic race with a promise to compete hard in Trump country.

While Trump has talked admiringly about the crowds of Sen. Kamala Harris of California, he has also spoken to confidantes about being impressed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who he has met several times and has spoken openly about her ability to connect with voters. He took a dig at her snowy announcement, which was a sign he took her candidacy seriously, given her track record of winning 42 counties last fall in Minnesota that Trump had carried two years earlier.

At the Republican National Committee and in the offices of the Trump re-election campaign, aides often follow the President's lead. If he tweets about a Democratic candidate or mentions a potential rival in conversation, they will amplify it. And they are waiting for Trump to nickname the candidates, which he is already working on doing, much like the derogatory branding he did for his own Republican rivals in 2016.

While Trump and his advisers believe they will escape a serious primary challenge, a team of aides is already working on shoring up Republican delegates to the party's convention and making sure local officials are on board.

""It's county-by-county,"" an aide involved in the campaign said, ""looking for people who didn't show up in the midterms.""

The President is optimistic about his chances, several advisers say, largely because of the data Parscale and others have shown him and what he sees as a leftward-leaning Democratic field.

While his national approval ratings approach record lows for a sitting president, Trump is seizing on other metrics. Aides say he is focusing on two types of counties: surge and switch, which he believes hold the key to his re-election. Surge counties are those where his support soared from the 2012 baseline of Mitt Romney, while switch counties are those that flipped from Barack Obama to Trump in four years.

But above all, the President is increasingly fixated on the Democratic primary.

It's become a regular topic on his phone calls with friends and Republican members of Congress. And it's now a staple of his daily television diet in the residence of the White House, a building he is fighting to stay in for a second term as president.

politico,Trump’s Phony Trade War with China,"Mark Wilson/Getty Images Washington And The World Trump’s Phony Trade War with China Reeling from his failure to cut a deal with Kim Jong Un, will the president end his pointless dispute with Beijing?

Zachary Karabell is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine.

All wars end—eventually.

So it is with the yearlong China-U.S. trade war, which now appears to be in its final stages. Tariffs will be lifted, Beijing will promise to buy more American goods and take a harder stance on technology transfers and industrial espionage, and Trump will declare victory.

Story Continued Below

Yet any victory will be Pyrrhic, at best. The China trade war has been both phony and costly—managing to unsettle the economies of the United States, China and the region. Trump has sown the seeds of future tension and distrust, while altering the structure of the relationship barely at all except perhaps marginally for the worse. Everything that the two sides are now scrambling to settle before a summit between Trump and Xi Jinping in late March could have been achieved without a year of rather pointless and toothless sanctions.

Trump, as always, is focused on The Deal. “We want to make it a meaningful deal,” he said just before announcing a delay in the March 1 deadline to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States, “not a deal that’s done and doesn’t mean anything. We want to make this a deal that’s going to last for many, many years and a deal that’s going to be good for both countries.”

Yet, as demonstrated by the bizarre spectacle of the president debating in front of the Chinese delegation and in the Oval Office with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about the meaning of a “memorandum of understanding” versus a “deal,” the optics of all of this remain most important to the White House.

In this phony war, the rhetoric has been much more substantial than the reality. Yes, there are stories galore of how these tariffs are hurting the Chinese, hurting American soybean farmers whose exports to China have plummeted, and undermining Xi’s iron grip on power. No doubt, the very fact of tariffs on a broad spectrum of goods has unsettled the relationship and created tremors in China as people there assess the possible consequences of a real economic rupture.

Yet, some basic math is instructive here. Ten percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods is, well, $20 billion a year; along with the 20 percent tariffs on around $50 billion on other Chinese products, which is $10 billion a year, that’s $30 billion. In the context of a bilateral trade relationship in goods of more than $600 billion a year, plus another $100 billion or so in services, it’s not much. Or zoom out even further: Trump’s vaunted tariffs represented about 4 percent of total trade. In the context of the $30 trillion-plus combined economies of the two countries, that amounts to well, very little.

And what’s more, the tariffs have dented overall U.S.-China trade activity barely at all, according to the official figures of the U.S. government. The run-rate for U.S. imports of Chinese goods—the ones Trump promised would soon be made once again in the United States—has remained fairly consistent. The U.S. trade deficit with China, which defenders of the trade war use as Exhibit A to prove that something has to be done, has actually increased in the past months. That’s because U.S. exports to China are down tens of billions of dollars—which is why those soybean farmers in the Midwest are receiving federal subsidies. So, contrary to Trump’s claims that the Chinese are “paying billions of dollars” to the U.S. Treasury, the primary economic repercussions of the trade war have been that Chinese companies and consumers are spending far less on American goods, while Americans have been paying a $30 billion annual tax, give or take. If the point of all of this was to reverse the trade deficit, force multinationals to shift production back to the U.S. and stop China from intellectual property theft, then it is hard to call this year anything other than smoke without fire.

Nor does it appear that the various and sundry agreements that will be part of Trump’s ultimate deal with Xi, assuming he gets one, are much different from agreements Beijing cut with Trump’s much-maligned predecessor, Barrack Obama. Xi and Obama met multiple times and agreed to end state-sanctioned cyber espionage. Xi also promised, cross his heart, that China would increase purchases of U.S. goods and take a close look at irritants in U.S.-China relations like mandatory technology transfers and rules limiting foreign ownership of companies in China. Beijing already did the easy part: Year by year, China has been buying more U.S. exports. As for the rest, not so much.

The problem with Trump’s phony trade war is that it has been just disruptive enough to cause consternation and insecurity on both sides of the Pacific and not nearly enough to force anyone to change much at all, except where things were changing anyway. Take intellectual property and joint ventures: Under Xi and his Made in China policy, Beijing has been investing heavily in domestic research and development. That has been bearing fruit in areas such as artificial intelligence and a home-grown 5G telecommunications standard, potentially leapfrogging China ahead of the United States. As a result of this success, China has its own reasons to both safeguard its own intellectual property and not rely on the United States—tariffs or no tariffs.

Especially given Trump’s failure in Hanoi, it is highly likely a U.S. president desperate for a win will strike some sort of deal with Xi. Those will include a promise by China to buy more American goods (which they were on course to do before the tariffs), to more strictly enforce intellectual property rules (which they are now doing anyway in order to protect their own domestic IP) and allow for more direct investment in China (which, given the levels of debt in China, they want anyway). Don’t, however, be fooled by Trump’s grandiose claims of success. This was a war America certainly didn’t need to fight, and probably didn’t even win.",2019,03,01,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/01/trump-phony-trade-war-china-225514
cnn,'Sometimes you have to walk': Trump leaves Hanoi with no deal,"Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) President Donald Trump's Hanoi summit with Kim Jong Un , meant to demonstrate his diplomatic gamble with North Korea is working, instead ended with no joint agreement after Kim insisted all US sanctions be lifted on his country.

That was a bridge too far for the US President, who said Kim offered to take some steps toward dismantling his nuclear arsenal but not enough to warrant ending the debilitating sanctions regime on the country.

""Sometimes you have to walk,"" Trump said during a news conference following the conclusion of the summit, which broke up earlier than planned. ""This was just one of those times.""

But it was evident from early in the summit that Trump was seeking to tamp down expectations, repeating he's in no rush to strike a deal even as North Korea continues to advance its nuclear weapons program.

""I've been saying very much from the beginning that speed is not that important to me,"" Trump said earlier Thursday at the summit's outset. ""Speed is not important to me. What is important is that we do the right deal.""

Trump cast the lack of deal as only a short-term disappointment, even though he'd hoped coming into the talks to be able to point to a new, concrete pathway toward denuclearization. A major agreement struck in Hanoi may also have pushed aside embarrassing headlines about Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen testifying the President is a racist conman.

The President, who said scheduling Cohen's testimony during his summit was a ""terrible thing,"" instead suggested the inconclusive talks with Kim were another step in a lengthy process toward convincing the young leader to abandon his nuclear program.

And the summit ended amicably, without either man storming away.

""It was a very friendly walk,"" Trump said.

'Closer'

Still, the absence of a joint agreement reflects an anticlimax for a summit event Trump had hoped would prove naysayers of his diplomacy wrong.

He conceded that US and North Korean officials remain at odds about the precise definition of denuclearization, which is the ostensible goal of his efforts.

""He has a certain vision and it's not exactly our vision, but it's a lot closer than it was a year ago and I think eventually we'll get there,"" Trump said.

And he described Kim as singularly focused on ending the sanctions that have crippled his economy and helped bring him to the negotiating table in the first place.

Trump said Kim had offered to begin dismantling the Yongbyon nuclear facility, a step that would have amounted to a major concession. But it wasn't enough, Trump said, alluding to additional sites that comprise what is a deeply secretive nuclear program.

""We asked him to do more and he was unprepared to do that,"" said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who joined Trump on stage for the duration of the news conference. ""Everyone had hoped we could do just a little bit better.""

US and North Korean negotiators had been in Hanoi for days drafting language of a joint agreement ahead of the talks, and the ceremony was listed on a version of the President's public schedule released Wednesday evening. Stephen Biegun, the President's North Korea envoy, arrived several days before Trump to seal the document.

During an expanded session with aides, Trump and Kim discussed the prospect of opening a US office in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. Kim said he would welcome the idea, and Trump deemed it a ""good idea.""

Yet afterward, it appeared the chances for that -- along with any other concessions or agreements -- were dashed, even as the White House insisted the talks were productive.

The two leaders departed the Metropole, the French-colonial hotel where the talks unfolded, around 1:30 p.m. local time, roughly four-and-a-half hours after the talks began.

They also left without participating in a working lunch, even as chefs had been preparing plates of foie gras and snow fish.

Lowered expectations

If the day ended without a triumphant finish, there were extraordinary moments peppered throughout the day.

In unprecedented back-and-forth exchanges with journalists, Kim insisted he was open to denuclearization, though didn't say what he believed that meant.

It's believed to be the first time Kim has answered a question from a foreign journalist, a landmark event for the iron-fisted dictator.

""If I'm not willing to do that I won't be here right now,"" he said through an interpreter.

Kim, for his part, also expressed cautious optimism earlier in the day that a deal would eventually be struck. But he did not suggest such an accord would come soon.

""It's too early to say,"" he said in response to a foreign journalist's shouted question. ""From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out.""

He again responded to journalists later in the day, albeit somewhat begrudgingly.

The two leaders went back-and-forth over the prospect of exchanging liaison officers -- a low level diplomatic partnership -- after the issue was raised by a journalist.

Initially, Kim seemed to reject the question, proposing to Trump that the media be excused from the room. But Trump seemed to goad him to answer, saying it was a good question.

""I would like to hear that answer,"" Trump said.

Kim responded through his interpreter, saying it would be something that was ""welcome-able.""

Trump expressed a similar sentiment: ""I actually think it's a good idea.""

Kim added it would be better for Trump and him to discuss it together in private.

Trump's dual objectives

Trump was pursuing two objectives as he sat down once again with the North Korean dictator on Thursday: draw North Korea closer to the prospect of abandoning its nuclear weapons and regain control of the media narrative.

As he arrived at the swanky Metropole Hotel on Wednesday to advance his historic direct diplomacy with Kim, Trump was quickly upstaged by the damning congressional testimony of his longtime former attorney and adviser Michael Cohen.

By the time Trump finished dinner with Kim , the airwaves were blanketed with coverage of Cohen's testimony. A grand agreement on denuclearization might have helped in that effort to change the narrative. But on Thursday Trump repeatedly downplayed the prospects of a deal emerging from the Hanoi talks and suggested something more vague might result from his second summit with Kim.

""I can't speak for today but over a little bit longer term ... we're going to have a fantastic success,"" Trump said.

He described his dinner an evening earlier as positive, but did not describe in detail any of the negotiations underway.

""A lot of great ideas being thrown about,"" Trump said.

The two leaders once again put their chummy personal relationship on display, walking along the flower-lined pool deck at the Metropole engaging in friendly conversation to give the cameras an opportunity to capture them in a more casual setting.

The images will only serve to fuel criticism that Trump's cozy diplomacy with Kim glosses over the rampant human rights abuses in North Korea , which include Kim's brutal assassinations of those who cross him and the imprisonment of thousands in labor camps. Trump largely avoided any mention of human rights during his talks with Kim, instead focusing on the prospects for financial investment if Kim agrees to abandon his nuclear weapons.

When a reporter asked Kim whether the topic was discussed, Trump answered for him.

""We're discussing everything,"" Trump said.

Later, when asked about the treatment of Otto Warmbier, an American student who spent 17 months in North Korean detention before being returned to the US in a vegetative state and subsequently dying, Trump denied Kim had been aware of the incident.

""He felt badly about it. He felt very badly,"" Trump said. ""He tells me that he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word.""

""I don't think that the top leadership knew about it,"" Trump added. ""I don't believe that he (Kim) would have allowed that to happen.""

While Trump continues to insist that there is no rush to make progress, North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear weapons program and expanded its nuclear arsenal. In just the past year, North Korea is estimated to have produced enough fissile material for an additional five to seven nuclear weapons, according to Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation

usatoday,"Donald Trump's weight up, cholesterol down, president's doctor discloses after physical exam","President Donald Trump on Air Force One (Photo11: NICHOLAS KAMM, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump weighed in at 243 pounds during his physical last week, an increase of four pounds from last year that makes him technically obese, according to a report released Thursday by the White House.

Trump's blood pressure, 118/80, was about the same as last year (122/74), while his cholesterol was down to 196 from 223 last year. The president has also had an increase in dosage of rosuvastatin (also known as Crestor), a drug designed to help reduce cholesterol levels.

""It is my determination that the President remains in very good health,"" said Dr. Sean Conley, the president's physician, in the report released by the White House.

The administration released the report in the midst of a busy news cycle, just minutes after officials announced that Trump would declare a ""national emergency"" at the border in a bid to obtain funding for a border wall.

Trump – who once described his exercise regimen as ""I walk, I this, I that"" – has long faced questions about his health. Last year, he was weighed at 239 pounds, giving the 6-foot-3 president a body mass index of 29.9, just under the level of 30 that is considered obese.

After the release of details from his latest physical, doctors on social media noted that Trump's height and weight give him a BMI of 30.4, just over the line of obesity.

Conley performed Trump's physical on Friday for more than four hours at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland.

Afterward, Conley wrote in a summary memo released by the White House that Trump ""is in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his presidency, and beyond."" But Conley provided no details at the time.

Conley said he performed and supervised the assessment along with a panel of 11 board-certified specialists.

The 72-year-old president doesn’t exercise regularly, beyond golf, and acknowledged last year he takes a drug designed to lower his cholesterol. On the other hand, Trump has eschewed tobacco and has said he's never had an alcoholic drink.

Dr. Ronny Jackson, who examined Trump last year, reported that – like many Americans – the president could use more exercise and a better diet lower in fat and carbohydrates. Jackson described Trump as being in ""excellent health.""

After anonymous sources questioned the president’s mental capacity in the bombshell book ""Fire and Fury,"" Jackson last year performed an assessment to screen for cognitive impairment. Trump got a perfect score, Jackson said.

""The president is mentally very sharp,"" Jackson said at the time.

Trump later nominated Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but the doctor withdrew his nomination amid a barrage of allegations of prior misconduct, including treatment of subordinates.

Other results from Trump's last two physicals:

• Trump's cholesterol level of 196 was down from last year's reading of 223, which was slightly over normal; his blood pressure readings in both years were well within the normal range.

• The president had a resting heart rate of 70 beats per minute, up from 68 beats per minute last year. Sixty to 100 beats per minute is considered normal.

• Trump has a history of elevated cholesterol and was taking a low dose of Crestor to treat it. This year, his doctor reported an increase in dosage of the drug to 40 mg.

cnn,"Former Trump campaign staffer sues, alleging that Trump kissed her without consent","Washington (CNN) A former Trump campaign staffer is suing President Donald Trump and his campaign, alleging that the then-Republican presidential candidate kissed her without her consent during the 2016 race. She's also suing over equal pay -- claiming that she was paid less for her work based on race and gender.

Alva Johnson, a former Trump campaign staffer who lives in Alabama, alleges in a lawsuit filed Monday that Trump grabbed her hand and forcibly kissed her without her consent inside an RV in Florida in August 2016.

While Trump was meeting with volunteers and signing autographs inside the RV, ""Ms. Johnson noticed that Defendant Trump was watching her and appeared to be trying to make eye contact with her,"" the lawsuit alleges.

After Trump was alerted by Secret Service that he was due for his next rally, she urged him ""to go in there and 'kick ass.'""

Trump then allegedly grasped her hand and praised her efforts.

""As Defendant Trump spoke, he tightened his grip on Ms. Johnson's hand and leaned towards her. He moved close enough that she could feel his breath on her skin,"" the lawsuit states. ""Ms. Johnson suddenly realized that Defendant Trump was trying to kiss her on the mouth, and attempted to avoid this by turning her head to the right. Defendant Trump kissed her anyway, and the kiss landed on the corner of her mouth.""

The lawsuit alleges that several witnesses saw incident, including then-Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, then-State Director Karen Giorno, and Regional Directors Earl ""Tony"" Ledbetter, Mitch Tyner and Nick Corvino.

The lawsuit alleges that Bondi smiled when the incident occurred and Giorno ""grabbed Ms. Johnson's elbow and gave it an approving tug.""

After the incident, on her way to the campaign's state headquarters in Sarasota, Florida, the suit claims that ""Johnson called her partner, and then her parents, to tell them about what had happened, crying as she recalled the incident.""

The lawsuit says Giorno had arrived in Sarasota earlier ""and was already sharing the details with other Campaign staff.""

Bondi said in a statement to CNN that the allegations Alva Johnson are making are ""false.""

""As a career prosecutor and Attorney General, had I seen anything improper I would have taken action,"" Bondi said. ""I was with the president in the RV and these allegations are false.""

Giorno did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Both she and Bondi told the Post that they did not recall the incident in the RV and denied reacting in the manner which Johnson described.

Johnson, whose background was in event planning and human resources, voted for Democrats in previous election cycles. ""However, she was intrigued by the possibility of working on the campaign of a relatively unknown political outsider like Defendant Trump,"" the lawsuit states.

But prior to being hired, Johnson says she first met Trump in November 2015 at a Birmingham, Alabama, rally. At that first encounter, Johnson alleges that he engaged in inappropriate behavior.

When Johnson walked up introduced herself to Trump, he allegedly, ""looked her up and down and said, 'Oh, beautiful, beautiful, fantastic.'""

Johnson was hired in January 2016, but after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape was publicized in October 2016, Johnson sought legal counsel for guidance over the RV incident. About a week after the tape's release, Johnson quit the campaign. The lawyer ultimately decide not to take the case, according to the lawsuit.

At her former lawyer's arrangement, Johnson saw a therapist.

""She continued to feel considerable emotional distress because of the forced kiss, and had nightmares about it,"" the lawsuit claims.

The lawsuit also claims that Johnson did not receive fair compensation, claiming that she was ""vastly underpaid"" when compared to her former male colleagues.

""Ms. Johnson was also underpaid compared to similarly qualified and less qualified male staffers,"" the lawsuit states. ""She did not know this fact until very recently. Ms. Johnson's experience is not isolated— indeed, the Campaign engaged in systemic gender discrimination in pay against its female employees.""

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said in a statement to CNN: ""The Trump campaign has never discriminated based on race, ethnicity, gender, or any other basis. Any allegation suggesting otherwise is off base and unfounded.""

Hassan Zavareei, Johnson's Washington-based attorney, told CNN that Johnson is coming out publicly with her allegation of sexual misconduct against President Trump because she ""decided that she couldn't be silent anymore.""

""She tried to hire a lawyer immediately after the 'Access Hollywood' tape came out ... After the lawyer decided it was basically too big a case for them and they weren't going to take it on, she decided to try to move on with her life,"" Zavareei said.

But after Trump's election, Zavareei said Johnson has been overcome with a ""sense of guilt and responsibility"" for any role she may have played in helping Trump win the election.

Johnson has been particularly upset about the Trump administration's policies affecting migrant families, Zavareei said.

""I think the thing that moved her most was seeing the forced separations -- she's a mother and feels very deeply about -- was very emotionally affected, personally affected, by seeing Trump put young children and put them in cages. She decided that she couldn't be silent anymore,"" he said.

Zavareei said his client is only one in a ""long line of victims in Donald Trump's predation.""

""Unlike so many of the other victims, she's the only one with the ability to sue him directly for his sexual misconduct. The other lawsuits have been for defamation or some of the victims haven't been able to bring any lawsuits at all because they've been barred by statute of limitations,"" he said. ""For that reason, I think she's uniquely situated to hold him accountable for an actual act of sexual assault.""

Zavareei added that with the launch of this lawsuit, Johnson is resigned to the fact that she is likely to be criticized from all sides.

""She knows as an African-American woman who worked on the campaign and now coming out against Trump, She's probably going to take it from both sides but she's ready to stand up and take responsibility for what she did,"" he said.

Johnson is now focused on doing ""what she can to hold him accountable for his sexist and racist conduct.""

According to the Post, three months after hiring Zavareei last year, Johnson ""moved to seal a years-old court case in which two family members sought a temporary restraining order against her,"" and was enjoined in the request to seal the records by the family members.

On some of the reporting in the Post about her relatives in Georgia, Zavareei said it was a ""silly sideshow"" and that ""everybody's on good terms"" now.

""It's a private family matter,"" Zavareei said, adding that is ""totally irrelevant"" to Johnson's case.

Asked why Johnson and her family took this action, Zavareei said through a spokesperson that it was ""to protect the privacy of her family.""

businessinsider,"Trump's trade war cost Americans $1.4 billion a month last year, according to a new report","AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin

Protectionist trade policies cost American consumers and importers $1.4 billion a month at the end of 2018, according to a new study.

While President Donald Trump has claimed foreign companies pay tariffs, economists say that isn't true.

If the tariffs that were in place at the end of 2018 were to continue, about $165 billion dollars of trade a year would continue to be redirected.

A spate of protectionist policies with trading partners reduced real US income by $1.4 billion a month at the end of 2018, according to a new study by economists at the New York Federal Reserve, Princeton, and Columbia.

Using official data on prices and quantities of imports, they found American consumers and businesses footed the bill following the $283 billion worth tariffs the Trump administration levied on major economies last year while overseas companies paid little to nothing.

""The entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters,"" economists Mary Amiti, Stephen Redding, and David Weinstein write.

Throughout his months-long trade war, President Donald Trump has repeated the dubious claim that other countries pay tariffs. Last year, he asserted they could start paying down ""large amounts"" of the national debt (which is more than 9,000 times what the Treasury Department has typically brought in from tariff revenue each month of the trade war).

But in reality, tariffs operate just like any other tax, meaning the associated costs can pass through supply chains and fall on those not directly involved. When the Treasury charges a country 25% to ship a product into the US, importers or their customers often have to absorb those costs.

In a year, the study suggests the net loss from tariffs would amount to $16.8 billion in the US. While that's a small fraction of annual gross domestic product, business conditions have also deteriorated from uncertainty and retaliatory actions.

Some of the US's largest trading partners, including China and the European Union, have pushed back at the Trump administration with tariffs of their own. About $121 billion of US exports were affected by reprisals at the end of 2018, according to the study.

Trump has argued his trade war will ultimately help Americans by pressuring countries to change policies seen as unfair, but economists and businesses have warned protectionism will continue to hurt growth at home and abroad. The study estimates that if current tariffs remain in place, $165 billion dollars of trade per year will be redirected.

“Our results imply that the tariff revenue the US is now collecting is insufficient to compensate the losses being born by the consumers of imports,” Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein write. “We also see similar patterns for foreign countries who have retaliated against the US, which indicates that the trade war reduces real income for the global economy as well.”

cnn,Trump's new climate panel is a waste of time and money,"Alice Hill is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution . She was formerly a federal prosecutor, judge, special assistant to the president and senior director for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. At the White House, she led the development of policy regarding national security and climate change, including the national flood risk management standard. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Imagine an ordinary courtroom scene. The judge sits above the crowd wearing a black robe while one of the lawyers questions a witness. The witness gives an answer, but it's not the one the lawyer was looking for. So, the lawyer asks the question again, but the witness gives the same answer. When the lawyer asks a third time, the attorney for the other side rises to her feet and exclaims, ""Objection! Asked and answered!"" The judge agrees and, in a voice dripping with irritation, tells the first lawyer to move on to another question.

Judges don't take kindly to repeated attempts to ask the same question in the hopes of getting a different answer. Nor should the court of American public opinion -- at least not when it comes to questioning whether climate change is occurring and why.

This latest White House proposal builds off an earlier plan championed by William Happer , a senior director on the National Security Council and physicist who claims that more carbon in the atmosphere is helpful, not harmful to the planet. The details regarding the proposed group have evolved in recent days, but the idea is the same: Establish a committee to question government climate reports concluding that fossil fuel emissions harm the planet.

Congress established the US Global Change Research Program in 1990 to coordinate climate research across 13 federal agencies with a mandate to produce a national climate assessment every few years. Last fall, the program released its latest assessment , which runs more than 1,500 pages. The report reflects the consensus statement of a team of 300 federal and non-federal experts who received input from stakeholders across the country during a two-year period of study. The assessment, which was subjected to review by experts, the general public and the federal government, underwent external peer review as well.

The report found that human-caused emissions of greenhouse gasses were negatively affecting everything from our infrastructure to our health. It didn't take long for President Donald Trump to announce , ""I don't believe it."" And now, because the President and his advisers don't like the answer the rest of the federal government and climate science keep giving them, the White House wants to ask the question again -- despite the assessment's clear and resounding conclusions.

The question the White House wants to raise -- whether fossil fuels are harming the planet -- has been asked and answered. Decisively. Asking the question again won't change the answer or the science. Many Americans already know that climate change is happening, and the percentage of those who are worried about its impact has risen sharply in five years, according to a national survey by Yale and George Mason universities.

More than two-thirds of Americans say that climate change is happening and they are ""worried about it,"" while 62% understand that global warming is caused mostly by human activities. Given that the United States is witnessing weather and climate-related extreme events that cause more and more damage, the public's conclusions should come as no surprise.

Re-examining the climate science is a waste of everyone's time and taxpayer money. More dangerously, the Trump administration's effort to push for a different answer reduces the government's focus on answering the urgent question of what to do about climate change and its impact. At this moment, those answers are lacking.

For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- responsible for helping the nation prepare for extreme weather -- didn't even bother to mention climate change in its strategic plan for 2018-2022 . And within months of taking office, Trump killed the federal agency planning requirements for climate change as well as efforts to address the national security risks. Just 10 days before Hurricane Harvey deluged Houston, Trump revoked the federal building standard designed to address increased flooding from climate change.

All of this has left the government and the American people desperately ill-prepared for the accelerating impact of climate change. Instead of rehashing questions that have been asked and answered, our government should be giving Americans the answers they need to prepare.",2019,03,02,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/02/opinions/trumps-new-climate-panel-is-a-waste-of-time-and-money-hill/index.html
aljazeera,Trump's border wall is another dangerous distraction,"On February 15, US President Donald Trump declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border in order to access funding for the construction of what he calls an ""absolutely critical"" border wall. Although he has repeatedly described the situation as a ""growing security crisis"", research shows that the number of undocumented individuals crossing from Mexico into the United States has been steadily decreasing in recent years.

Trump has relentlessly demonised border crossers, calling them ""criminal illegal aliens"" who have created ""the lawless state of our southern border"".

There is indeed lawlessness at the US-Mexico border, but some of the most egregious criminal acts are being carried out by the US border patrol and have been validated and perpetuated by US courts.

Human rights are being systematically violated so extensively that we can certainly acknowledge an ""emergency"" at the border. The separation of families and horrendous mistreatment of children in detention centres has attracted some public attention, but other abuses remain unaddressed.

Border patrol agents have been violating the rights to water and food of border crossers for years. Now they are also targeting the very people who are documenting these violations and attempting to provide essential water and food aid.

The weaponisation of water

In the 1990s, the Clinton administration adopted a ""prevention through deterrence"" strategy which effectively sealed off entry points near urban areas at the US-Mexico border, forcing border crossers to take risky routes through desert areas.

Since then, over 7,000 bodies have been found near the border, with estimates putting the real number of deaths caused by dehydration, heat stroke, hypothermia, etc at 21,000. Distressed by these tragic deaths, local people have sought to help prevent further loss of life by leaving water and food along desert routes.

But these humanitarian initiatives have not been welcomed by the border patrol.

In January 2018, a humanitarian group called No More Deaths published a report detailing how between 2012 and 2015 border patrol agents destroyed 3,586 gallon jugs of water left behind for border crossers in the Sonoran desert of Arizona. They also released footage of border guards kicking and pouring out water containers.

As the report points out: ""Hundreds of vandalism acts cannot be dismissed as the misguided behaviour of a few bad apples. Rather, after extensive statistical analysis, we conclude that the culture and policies of the US Border Patrol as a law-enforcement agency both authorize and normalize acts of cruelty against border crossers.""

The US border patrol has adopted a practice as part of its policing activities that clearly violates human rights.

The right to water is also recognised under international law in UN Resolution 64/292, which acknowledges that ""the right to safe and clean drinking water … as a human right … is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights."" The right to food is recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Impeding humanitarian relief violates customary international humanitarian law, which includes an ""obligation to allow the free passage of relief supplies”.

Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the ICC includes ""… deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population …"" in the definition of extermination, a crime against humanity. It also identifies ""wilfully impeding relief supplies as provided for under the Geneva Conventions"" as a war crime.

Border crossers are not the only ones whose right to water and food is violated within the borders of the US. Communities across the country, including in Flint, Michigan and Dimock, Pennsylvania, know what violations of the human right to water mean all too well.

The weaponisation of water is also not a practice exclusive to the US border patrol. Israel uses it regularly against the Palestinian population. It is easy to recognise Palestinian homes in occupied Palestine by checking the roofs for black water tanks, which Palestinians have to keep because they are regularly denied access to water and must perpetually store emergency supplies.

Unsurprisingly, Trump has expressed affection for Netanyahu's extreme right-wing government, applauding his militarised security policies, while coveting his wall and citing it as a model for the US.

While cruel ""deterrence"" practices that violate human rights along the US-Mexico border long predate Trump's election, under his administration, the ""bad apples"" of border protection are overwhelmingly calling the shots, and the courts are now unprecedentedly validating their actions.

Criminalising humanitarian work

The criminalisation of humanitarian work is evidenced by the recent targeting of No More Deaths volunteers.

On Friday, a federal court in the state of Arizona sentenced four American women - Natalie Hoffman, Oona Holcomb, Madeline Huse, and Zaachila Orozco-McCormick - on misdemeanour charges for having left water and food in the desert back in summer 2017.

Officially, the women - all No More Deaths volunteers - were convicted for entering Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge without a permit and leaving behind supplies, but the activists suspect that the charges were politically motivated.

Hours after the January 2018 report was released, another No More Deaths volunteer, Scott Warren, was arrested and charged with harbouring undocumented immigrants.

The four women now have criminal records, which could greatly affect their personal and professional lives, while Warren faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

These convictions set a dangerous precedent that strengthens and normalises the campaign to criminalise humanitarian work in the US. International law regarding basic rights faces daunting enforceability challenges, but Trump's systematic attacks on human rights must be documented, resisted, and demolished.

Given that international humanitarian law applies only during armed conflict, we must also ask: Is the US not at war at the border, given the thousands of lives lost? The status of border-crossers and terminology used to describe them - refugees, economic migrants, asylum-seekers, illegal aliens, victims of violence -are irrelevant. They are indisputably entitled to rights to water and food.

In this context, Trump's border wall project and the debate over funding it has provoked constitute yet another dangerous distraction. The Trump administration has repeatedly demonstrated that it seeks not only to erode human rights in the US, but also to dismantle human rights protections internationally.

The urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. As one border crosser told No More Deaths, ""We would die without water, and they [the border patrol] don't want us to live.""

So stay tuned - the US government is targeting humanitarian workers who provide water and food to people on the brink of death. Have you done any volunteer work for the starving or water deprived lately? You could be next.

washingtonpost,Trump’s national emergency declaration once again highlights his affinity for strongmen — and authoritarianism,"President Trump has long displayed a soft spot for strongmen.

He has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for exerting “strong control over a country” and said Rodrigo Duterte is doing a “great job,” even as the Philippine president was accused of allowing thousands of extrajudicial killings. He has spoken favorably of Chinese President Xi Jinping and said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has “a great personality, he’s a funny guy, he’s very smart.”

Now, with his national emergency declaration, Trump once again showed an affinity for authoritarianism.

At a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Trump announced that he would declare a national emergency to secure funds for a border wall specifically denied to him by Congress. Critics warned it was a clear subversion of the American system of checks and balances, and possibly unconstitutional.

At the ceremony, Trump didn’t address any of those concerns. Instead, after NBC News’s Peter Alexander challenged him on why he was proceeding without the support of Congress, Trump explained that he was frustrated that the lawmakers wouldn’t give him what he wants. “I didn’t need to do this,” he said. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”

He then blamed the politics of the 2020 election for Democrats not supporting the wall, saying, “I just want to do it faster.”

Trump also spoke at the news conference about the ongoing trade negotiations with China. “We’re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot,” Trump said. “Very good relationship that we have.” But that relationship has basically ignored China’s human rights atrocities, such as its treatment of the Muslim Uighur population.

Trump also explicitly praised China’s approach to its drug problem, saying, “President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs, and it’s a criminal penalty, and the penalty is death.” Human rights groups have said China’s judicial system and punishment of drug offenders can be arbitrary and unnecessarily harsh.

In his remarks, Trump also praised China, along with Russia, in pressuring North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.

“China’s been helping us, and Russia’s been helping us. And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan,” he said. “But China, Russia on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing, and that’s okay, as per the United Nations.”

In referencing his upcoming meeting with North Korea’s Kim, Trump spoke pleasantly of his relationship with the leader widely viewed as a brutal dictator. “I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim. We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United Nations.”

These statements reflect Trump’s transactional view toward foreign policy: It really doesn’t matter what you do to your own people, as long as you are doing what I want.

One of Trump’s greatest criticisms of Barack Obama was his belief that his predecessor regularly overstepped his bounds as president. But Trump’s words and actions suggest he’s not opposed to other national leaders having such broad powers, including himself. His latest maneuver is sure to attract the attention of his critics, the courts and maybe even some lawmakers worried about executive overreach.",2019,02,15,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/15/trumps-national-emergency-declaration-once-again-highlights-his-affinity-strongmen-authoritarianism/
indianexpress,"Trumps scuttle plan for hotels, blaming politics","(Written by Steve Eder, Ben Protess and Eric Lipton)

Advertising

In the early months of the Trump administration, with the president no longer running his family business, his eldest sons embarked on a plan to roll out two new hotel lines in dozens of American cities. It reflected the ambitions of “the next generation of the company,” President Donald Trump’s son Eric said at the time.

Now, in a striking reversal, the Trump Organization is no longer pursuing the signature initiative, according to company officials.

Plans for the two hotel chains, Scion and American Idea, are to be shelved indefinitely, most likely for the remainder of the presidency. As a practical matter, that means calling off just one agreement, in Mississippi, though two years ago the Trump Organization said it had as many as 30 potential deals in the pipeline.

Advertising

The retrenchment comes as the company faces growing scrutiny from federal prosecutors and congressional investigators, and as a former employee, Michael Cohen, heads to prison for multiple crimes. With Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives, any new hotel deals could have provided investigative fodder for critics of the president.

“We live in a climate where everything will be used against us, whether by the fake news or by Democrats who are only interested in presidential harassment and wasting everyone’s time, barraging us with nonsense letters,” Eric Trump said in a statement. “We already have the greatest properties in the world and if we have to slow down our growth for the time being, we are happy to do it.”

The decision to walk away from the hotel plans is the latest and clearest sign of the perils of running a family business whose owner occupies the White House. As Eric Trump and his brother Donald Jr. downsize the Trump Organization’s hotel ambitions, the president has lamented the toll that elected office has taken on the company. “I lost massive amounts of money doing this job,” he told The New York Times in a recent interview. “This is one of the great losers of all time.”

Some of those losses stem from an ethics code that Trump was encouraged to adopt: It has prevented the company from doing new business abroad during his presidency, halting the global growth that for years brought in millions of dollars in fees. But other wounds have been more directly self-inflicted. In the United States, where the company intended to open the Scion and American Idea hotels, Trump’s divisive rhetoric and polarizing politics have turned his brand into a target for opponents.

The Trump Organization, which the president continues to own, faced local opposition to potential Scion deals in cities like Dallas and St. Louis. Some potential development partners were also scared away by the prospect of intense media coverage and legal and financial vetting from the company’s outside ethics adviser, people briefed on the matter said.

The people said that as of Thursday the Trump Organization was walking away from more than a dozen potential deals in Washington, D.C., and at least five states.

The only new hotel deal the Trumps had announced was in the Mississippi Delta, a remote region unlike anywhere the company had done business. The Trumps planned to collaborate with local hoteliers, the brothers Dinesh and Suresh Chawla, on one Scion and as many as three American Idea hotels.

In a statement about parting ways with the Chawlas, the Trump Organization left open the possibility of reviving the Scion and American Idea brands. The Trumps praised the Chawlas and the would-be Scion property, predicting it would still be “an absolutely spectacular project.”

Dinesh Chawla, whose company plans to move forward on the hotels without Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, declined to comment beyond the statement. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it is unclear whether the Trumps were required to compensate the Chawlas in some way for pulling out. In the joint statement, the Chawlas said, “We understand their position completely.”

The failure to launch was hardly foreseen in June 2017, when the Chawlas appeared at Trump Tower in New York to announce the partnership. Donald Jr. told the story of how the families originally met — the Chawlas’ immigrant father had sought business advice decades earlier from Donald Trump, who surprisingly returned the call.

Then, at the end of the event, Eric Trump spoke optimistically about the company’s new direction. “You just wait to see what we do,” he teased a crowd of hotel executives, channeling his father’s flair for salesmanship.

While the retreat from Scion and American Idea is a setback for the company, it also signals that the Trump presidency takes priority over the Trump bottom line.

Long before Eric Trump’s statements on Thursday, some senior executives at the Trump Organization expressed concern that expanding the hotel operation could backfire and reflect poorly on the president, according to the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The executives worried that any potential new deals could lead to accusations that the company — and its owner — were profiting from the presidency.

In late 2017, Eric Trump foreshadowed a shift in strategy, indicating in an interview that the company would concentrate on its existing golf, real estate and hotel properties.

“If we have to take a break for an eight-year period of time or a four-year period, then it is what it is,” he said, referring to new business opportunities.

At the outset of the presidency, Donald Trump’s sons inherited a company that was coming off a decade of growth, having opened a slate of golf courses and luxury hotels from Chicago to Las Vegas. Marketing deals put the Trump name on properties around the world, as well as on suits, mattresses and a host of other products.

The presidency proved to be a game changer.

The Trump name became so toxic in some places that the company was paid to remove it from hotels in Toronto and New York. The majority owner of the Trump hotel in Panama took a more drastic step, ordering the T-R-U-M-P letters pried off the property with a crowbar.

In the last two years, the company has also been under scrutiny from federal investigators and Democrats in Congress, particularly after Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging hush money payments during the presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Donald Trump. The Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for one of those payments, and is itself a focus of the ongoing investigation.

The company has also faced a torrent of negative media coverage, most recently over revelations, first reported in The Times, about its employment of unauthorized immigrant workers. The reports, which prompted a review of its properties’ staffs and the firing of more than two dozen workers, came at a time when Trump was denouncing illegal immigration as a threat to national security.

Still, the presidency has not put a damper on all aspects of Trump’s business. Some international deals that were in the works before the election have moved forward, including a Trump-branded hotel in Vancouver and a golf course in Dubai that opened in early 2017, and other plans that are still underway in India, Uruguay and the Philippines.

The Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened 2016, has surpassed expectations, with its lobby regularly packed with Republican officials and operatives. It has also caused headaches for the company, having prompted lawsuits claiming that Trump is illegally profiting from the presidency. Two cases now working their way through the courts focus on whether patrons of his hotels hail from overseas or state governments, a potential violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution.

Trump brushed off those concerns in the recent interview with The Times, suggesting that any new business dealings were more than offset by lost opportunities. During the presidential campaign, about six months before his surprising victory, Trump told The Times that he had about 120 deals in the pipeline. His executives had been working on hotel projects across the globe, including in Israel, Saudi Arabia and China.

After the election, the self-imposed prohibition on new development in foreign countries caused the Trump Organization to cancel some proposed deals and its pipeline to rapidly shrink, the company has said. Just before taking office, Trump said his company had turned down a potentially lucrative deal in Dubai.

Closer to home, where fewer restrictions applied, the company focused on the prospect of new hotel lines in cities such as Cincinnati; Nashville, Tennessee; and Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

The hotels were intended to target an audience different from the patrons of the existing five-star Trump properties. The Scion, a four-star line, would be a hipper boutique option. American Idea, a chain of budget-friendly hotels, would feature hints of Americana. Scion was announced before Trump’s election, and the concept for American Idea materialized after the Trumps spotted an opportunity during the campaign to expand into farther-flung markets with fewer hotel options.

Potential partners, though, were put under a microscope.

The company aborted a Scion deal that was under discussion in Dallas, after The Times reported that the prospective partner had ties to Russia and Kazakhstan and the Trumps’ outside ethics adviser raised questions about the potential deal. The Times also reported that the Chawlas, the partners in Mississippi, had turned to the state government for millions of dollars in support through a tax rebate program.

New business activity slowed even further last year, and the company announced no new hotel deals. The Trump Organization briefly managed a Livingston, New Jersey, hotel owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and was in talks to open a Scion on the Jersey Shore that the Kushners would have owned. Both of those endeavors fell through.

The Mississippi hotels seemed to be the exception. Though they were far behind schedule, the hotels showed signs of progress last year, including laying the foundation for some of the buildings.

Trump hotel executives visited Mississippi and spent considerable time working with the Chawlas to revise the plans for the hotels.

The Chawlas, in the statement, left open the possibility of doing business with the Trumps in the future. “We hope that when the time is right,” they said, “we can work with Trump Hotels again.”",2019,02,15,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/trumps-scuttle-plan-for-hotels-blaming-politics-5585274/
washingtonpost,Michael Cohen’s revelations advance Trump’s inevitable reckoning,"Columnist

In Michael Cohen’s historic testimony Wednesday, there was a moment when the long-lost spines of President Trump’s political enablers, probably heaped in a clattering pile somewhere, must have felt a chill. It was when Cohen looked at his Republican inquisitors and foretold their future.

“I did the same thing you are doing now for 10 years,” Cohen said, sounding like an Old Testament prophet. “I protected Mr. Trump for 10 years. . . . And I can only warn [that] people that follow Mr. Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I’m suffering. . . . Look at what’s happened to me. I had a wonderful life. I have a beautiful wife. I have two amazing children. I achieved financial success by the age of 39. I didn’t go to work for Mr. Trump because I had to. I went to work for him because I wanted to. And I have lost it all.”

Cohen’s warning was ignored by those present. But his revelations advanced the inevitable day of reckoning — for Trump, his family and his party.

Early in his opening statement before the House Oversight Committee, Cohen gave a description of Trump that will go down in the annals of congressional testimony: “He is a racist, he is a con man, and he is a cheat.” Incredibly, none of the Republicans on the panel even tried to refute the claim that the president of the United States is, in his essence, an unscrupulous grifter.

One of them, Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), did make a clueless and embarrassing attempt to defend Trump against the charge of racism. He brought out Lynne Patton — an African American friend of the Trump family who, with utterly no relevant qualifications or experience, was given a high-ranking job in the Department of Housing and Urban Development — as evidence that Trump is not a racist. Patton stood silently in the background, like an artifact on exhibit. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was absolutely right to slam Meadows for using a black woman as “a prop.”

For the record, it’s entirely possible to have a black friend and still be a racist. If you can’t or won’t understand that fact, you may be a racist yourself. But I digress.

Another Republican made a weak attempt to challenge Cohen on one of his more sensational claims — that Trump never expected to win the presidency and instead saw his campaign as the “greatest infomercial in political history.” But there was no real effort to dispute Cohen’s many specific charges against Trump or even to question his shocking portrait of the man he once idolized.

Instead, the GOP strategy was to follow the old courtroom adage: If the facts are against you, pound the law. If the law is against you, pound the facts. And if both are against you, pound the table.

Oh, the table-pounding! Republicans found it outrageous that Cohen, whose admitted crimes include having once lied to Congress, was being allowed to sit there and testify, rather than, I don’t know, being dragged down to the basement and horsewhipped. How could anyone ever believe anything he had to say?

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) was so overwrought that I feared he might pull a muscle when he briefly thought he had caught Cohen in a lie on a boilerplate witness form. It turned out that Jordan was wrong — Cohen filled in the form correctly — and all the congressman injured was his pride.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the committee’s chairman, did a masterful job of presiding over the circus. He saved his best for last, ending the hearing with a closing statement that appealed to the better angels of our nature, wherever they might be hiding. “We’re better than this,” he thundered. And I so hope he’s right.

But I fear there will be darkness before the dawn.

Thanks largely to clever, substantive questioning by junior Democrats — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) being perhaps the most clever — there are new leads to follow. Cohen spoke of a whispered exchange between Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. that suggests, but does not prove, that Trump colluded with the Russians. Cohen said the Trump Organization committed insurance fraud and was involved in other unspecified criminal activity. He gave the House Democratic majority ample reason to subpoena Trump’s income taxes.

But the Trump he described was even more ruthless, selfish, amoral, dishonest and insecure — more unfit to be president — than we could have imagined. Getting him out of office is an urgent task for our democracy. We must be up to it.

cnn,Texans solidly against Trump's decision to declare a national emergency,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration to build his border wall will affect Texas more than any other state, and the residents of the Lone Star State are soundly against his decision to use those powers.

Three in five Texas voters disapprove of Trump using his emergency executive powers to fund a wall, according to a poll by Quinnipiac University released Tuesday. That includes 22% of Republicans, 63% of independents and a whopping 99% of Democrats.

A little more than half of voters said they don't think undocumented immigrants crossing the border with Mexico into the US is a national emergency. Overall, Texans are split on their support for Trump's wall -- 48% support building a wall along the border with Mexico and 48% oppose it.

The House passed a resolution to overturn Trump's national emergency declaration Tuesday evening by 245-182. The Senate will be required by law to hold a vote on the resolution within 18 days following passage in the House.

Texas has the largest amount of land without fencing or any other type of barrier of the four states along the US-Mexico border.

cnn,Trump's July 4th celebration sounds like a salute to Trump,"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) I think it's safe to say that President Donald Trump wants this July 4th to be all about him. At least that's the impression I got reading his Sunday morning tweet about the summer holiday celebration he is planning: ""HOLD THE DATE! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C., on July 4th. It will be called ""A Salute To America"" and will be held at the Lincoln Memorial. Major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me!""

While it'd be wonderful if Trump's proposed event was actually about celebrating the founding of our country, given Trump's tendency to make nearly everything about himself, this seems highly unlikely.

Dean Obeidallah

Trump's tweet reveals details about the celebration he has in mind. He's promising to organize ""one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C."" at the Lincoln Memorial -- complete with a ""Major fireworks display"" and ""entertainment."" And if you had any doubt what this so-called ""Salute to America"" is really all about, Trump made it clear by telling us how this event will be headlined -- with ""an address by your favorite President, me!""

Trump's tweet about his planned July 4th rally was followed a short time later by tweets about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a man who imprisons , tortures and kills those accused of ""political crimes."" In one such tweet , Trump bragged that he has a ""Great relationship with Chairman Kim!! ""

Trump's call for the ""biggest gathering in the history of Washington,"" where he can address thousands of Americans at once, made me think of Kim's massive rally in 2017 , where thousands of North Koreans gathered to hear Kim speak and pledge their loyalty to him.

Ever since China was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the trade imbalance between the United States and China has become more and more lopsided. In 2001, the deficit stood at $83 billion. In 2017, it reached $375 billion. Rather than moving toward a more open economy, as enthusiasts of WTO membership predicted, China has intensified its policies of state-led capitalism and protectionism. Combined with its outright technology theft, these policies have enabled China to achieve domination in industry after industry, with grave economic and geopolitical consequences for the U.S.

Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, aims to change that. He is dead serious about using America’s economic and political leverage to reset the U.S.-China relationship. An anomaly among Trump’s appointees, Lighthizer is deeply knowledgeable about his subject, strategically clear about his goals, and tactically astute as a negotiator. And unlike his last four predecessors as USTR, Lighthizer unabashedly embraces a salutary brand of nationalism. To use a very old-fashioned word, Lighthizer is a patriot, someone who truly cares about whether U.S. industry endures—and a far more serious man than his boss.

There’s only one person who can undermine what Lighthizer is trying to achieve. That would be Donald Trump. Why? Because in the next few days or weeks, Trump is looking for a quick deal that gives him bragging rights, while Lighthizer is playing a long game for systemic change. The president’s predictably failed summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, as he comes home to face the aftermath of the Michael Cohen hearings, only increases the pressure for a successful “signing summit” on trade with China’s Xi Jinping.

As Trump has waived his own March 1 deadline for a major increase in tariffs on Chinese goods absent a major agreement, he has sounded more and more bullish about the prospects of a deal, issuing tweets on the great progress that has been made. In reality, the main progress has come in the form of Chinese offers to buy more stuff—soybeans, beef, chickens, natural gas, semiconductors—but not to make changes in China’s mercantilist system of state support for its own industries.

On Monday, Trump crowed to a White House gathering of the nation’s governors that “we’re going to have another summit, we’re going to have a signing summit, which is even better, so hopefully we can get that completed, but we’re getting very, very close.”The more Trump trumpets success before true game-changing progress has been agreed to, however, the more he creates pressure for a bad deal, and the more he undercuts his own negotiators.

If Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping can announce an agreement consisting of specific commitments to purchase lots more U.S. products, plus some vague, token, and easily evaded promises to reduce aspects of Chinese mercantilism, it would produce three big tactical wins for the president. First, as Trump looks forward to the 2020 election, there will be favorable headlines that Trump has come to his senses on tariffs and avoided a “trade war” with China. The farm lobby and farm-belt voters will be relieved and grateful. So will the large segment of American corporations and banks that profit from the status quo. The Dow will jump several hundred points, reflecting both general approval and the prospect of increased exports and profits. Best of all, the deal will be announced at Mar-a-Lago, with a smiling Xi at Trump’s side.

And China’s system will not change at all.

Should that happen, it will be a stunning defeat for the man who is probably Trump’s most competent and conscientious appointee. To date, says China journalist and scholar James Mann, “Lighthizer has been the driving force in persuading Trump not to take deals that would generate headlines but not alter China’s system.” It will take something close to a miracle for Lighthizer to prevail again this time.

Robert Lighthizer was born in 1947, in Ashtabula, Ohio, where he watched the steel industry slowly vanish from the American Midwest of his boyhood. He attended college and law school at Georgetown, practiced law at the blue-chip firm Covington and Burling, and then served as trade counsel and later chief of staff to the Senate Finance Committee under the chairmanship of Kansas Republican Robert Dole. In 1983, President Reagan appointed Lighthizer to be deputy U.S. trade representative, where he became one of the administration’s two notable trade hawks, along with Clyde Prestowitz, whose title was counselor to the Secretary of Commerce.

In those years, the main Asian mercantilist threat to U.S. industry came from Japan (whose model China was to adapt and intensify). At first, Reagan’s negotiators attempted to persuade the Japanese to operate their economy more in the U.S. image, with transparent prices and open markets. With great fanfare, negotiators announced an initiative called the MOSS Talks, for Market-Oriented Sector-Selective. It soon became evident that the Japanese were masters of evasion and indirection. The joke became that MOSS stood for More Of the Same Stuff. As it became clear that Japan was not about to open its markets, Lighthizer and Prestowitz reluctantly settled for a series of second-bests. These included ad hoc deals for “voluntary restraint” of Japanese exports such as steel, autos, and semiconductors, as well as some selective reduction of Japan’s barriers to imports.

“Bob helped author the approach of negotiating results-oriented trade agreements that set specific metrics on whether Japan was abiding by its promises and ensuring that swift and sure retaliation would occur if Japan broke its promises,” says Michael Wessel, one of the Democratic members of the U.S.-China Commission. “That’s the same approach we should be taking with China.” (The independent commission, created by Congress in 2000, has functioned as a kind of loyal opposition to the conventional wisdom about China.) Those Japan deals did produce some gains, but their failure to fundamentally alter Japan’s national system was seared into Lighthizer’s consciousness, and was good preparation for his role today as America’s lead China negotiator.

Japan, moreover, was and is a democracy, with no global hegemonic ambitions. For much of the past quarter-century, Japan’s economy has been bogged down in a deflationary spiral, though its manufacturing export sector is as strong as ever. China is a whole other story. And, as Prestowitz observes, Japan was also a national-security client of the U.S., providing the U.S. with some pressure points. Not so China.

After working for Reagan, Lighthizer returned to private legal practice in 1985, specializing in trade cases, mainly representing U.S. companies whose businesses have been harmed by the protectionist policies of other nations, notably China. In representing scores of companies directly damaged by that nation’s state subsidies, dumping, technology theft, preferential cartels, and other aspects of mercantilism, and filing appeals of those practices to agencies such as the Commerce Department, Lighthizer gained an intimate look at just how Chinese mercantilism operates—and the pathetic limits of the usual U.S. tools.

That experience has proved invaluable. Prestowitz says: “Think of Cool Hand Luke when you consider Bob Lighthizer in a trade negotiation. He knows the trade laws, the history of the trade organizations, the key trade cases, the major players in virtually all countries, cold. He doesn’t get excited. Doesn’t lose his temper, but can be impatient with nonsense from his negotiating partner. In short, he’s a pro’s pro.”

“Always remember that before China there were Japan and Korea who followed policies similar to those of China today. Bob knows they and we are not playing the same game. We’re playing tennis and they are playing football. He is bound and determined that we put on some helmets and pads.”

Out of government, Lighthizer was one of the key informed critics of U.S. China policy, regularly testifying, giving speeches, and writing op-eds, as well as litigating on behalf of U.S. companies that bore the brunt of China’s policies. On the eve of the tenth anniversary of China’s accession to the WTO, in 2010, Lighthizer presented encyclopedic testimony to the U.S.-China Commission, detailing every aspect of Chinese mercantilism and American wishful thinking. Lighthizer concluded:

The optimistic promises made at the time Congress approved PNTR [Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China] have not been fulfilled. Years of passivity and drift among U.S. policymakers have allowed the U.S.-­China trade deficit to grow to the point where [it] is widely recognized as a major threat to our economy. Going forward, U.S. policymakers should take these problems more seriously, and should take a much more aggressive approach in dealing with China.

For the past two decades, Lighthizer has been a voice in the wilderness. His 2010 report read like an audition piece for some future President Trump. And in Trump, he found an improbable champion.

It is a little embarrassing for progressives to credit Donald Trump for doing even one thing right, in this case pursuing the serious China policy that has eluded the last several presidents. Trump, in his intuitive and feral fashion, grasped the music. It fell to Lighthizer to provide the words. But Trump may yet demonstrate that even on China, what appears to be a propitious convergence of goals is just another fake.

Lighthizer’s reality-based China policy stands in marked contrast to Trump’s delusional, blowhard, and self-defeating policies nearly everywhere else—from Iran to Syria to Saudi Arabia, and from Russia, Korea, and Germany to Hungary and Poland. Indeed, our China diplomacy is made more difficult because Trump’s ad hoc affronts to the EU have removed one crucial ally that the U.S. sorely needs in its China policy. If Trump does end up undercutting Lighthizer for a deal that produces cheap headlines and no fundamental changes, it will be of a piece with Trump’s diplomacy elsewhere in the world.

Donald Trump’s ascension to the presidency left Beijing bewildered. Since the Clinton administration, the Chinese government has known exactly how to play Washington: make token concessions, while buying off key industries and notables, so that proponents of a harder line would be dismissed as protectionist “China-bashers.” But it was not at all clear to the Chinese what Trump wanted from Beijing, or how to play him. The fact that Trump kept changing his rhetoric and demands created further puzzlement on the part of the Chinese. Did these shifts represent a higher order of deceptive tactical brilliance, or just incoherence?

The Chinese pursued a two-part strategy. First, knowing Trump’s personal corruptibility, they sought ways to buy him, either directly or though members of his family. Trump got expedited trademark approval for sales in China of Ivanka’s product lines. Chinese officials spent great effort cultivating Jared Kushner, whose family’s company has Chinese real-estate connections. In May 2017, Kushner’s sister, Nicole Meyer, made a pitch to more than 100 prospective Chinese investors at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing for $150 million in financing on behalf of the Kushner Companies for a proposed Jersey City housing development known as One Journal Square.

It was only after Lighthizer and national-security officials leaned hard on the president, and additional details of Jared and his family’s China plans were leaked by hard-liners to The New York Times, that Trump personally shut down this back channel and kept “Javanka” far away from China diplomacy. A planned second trip was prudently killed, and the Chinese financing of the Jersey City deal was abandoned.

The other Chinese strategy, as noted, has been to see whether Trump could be induced to relent in exchange for promises to buy ever-increasing amounts of stuff. China’s latest offer, leaked last week, is to buy an additional $30 billion in soybeans, wheat, corn, and other farm products. But the chronic trade deficit is the product of China’s mercantilist system. And the real problem facing the U.S. is the strategic threat posed by that system, not the trade deficit per se.

When Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with them in May 2017, Chinese officials offered a similar deal: more access for exports of U.S. beef and chicken, as well as some credit card services, in exchange for the U.S. abandoning tariffs and other demands. Mnuchin put out the word that the U.S. had an agreement. Lighthizer, national-security officials, and White House economist and trade adviser Peter Navarro strenuously resisted.

AP Photo/Evan Vucci After a few purely symbolic forays at places like the Carrier plant in Indiana, where he used threats and slogans to keep a tiny number of manufacturing jobs from moving south of the border, Trump turned to NAFTA. Here, people watch as Trump arrives at the Carrier plant during the 2016 campaign.

For more than a year, Mnuchin and the hard-liners have skirmished over whether to accept a deal that would include no fundamental changes in China’s system. At one fraught meeting, in May 2018, Navarro and Lighthizer got into a screaming and cursing match after Navarro learned that Mnuchin had secretly arranged a private high-level meeting with his Chinese counterpart, excluding other members of the U.S. delegation.

But Trump has refused to take the deals promoted by Mnuchin and the Chinese. Instead, the president doubled down and increased the pressure on China. On July 6, 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on 818 categories of goods imported from China, worth $34 billion, as retaliation for Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property under Sec. 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. It is standard practice for the Chinese government to coerce American companies seeking to do business in China to transfer trade secrets to Chinese “partners.” China also ignores patents and steals technology outright. The stakes were raised when Trump set a deadline of March 1, 2019, for a broader trade deal, or tariffs would rise from 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. This grand strategy is largely Lighthizer’s work.

There is an old saying that even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Lighthizer marks the rare case of Trump both stumbling into a better policy than that of his predecessors, and hiring the right person to carry it out. In the 2016 campaign, Trump seized on economic nationalism as a theme that tapped into the frustrations of blue-collar workers that good jobs were moving offshore and that Democrats like Hillary Clinton seemed to care more about Davos than Dubuque, and more about the rights of Mexican immigrants who were here illegally than about law-abiding white Americans. Economic nationalism, as defined by Trump, served both to racialize the campaign and to create a faux-populism that camouflaged the extent to which Trump was actually a garden-variety corporate Republican on nearly every other issue from taxes to deregulation to union-bashing.

But having associated himself with economic nationalism in the campaign, Trump in office needed to define and execute it. After a few purely symbolic forays at places like the Carrier plant in Indiana, where he used threats and slogans to keep a tiny number of manufacturing jobs from moving south of the border, Trump turned to NAFTA. This was part of his larger ploy of demonizing Mexico and humiliating Canada for good measure.

The NAFTA negotiations sucked out a huge amount of oxygen and consumed extensive time and energy away from the more existential challenge posed by China. When his negotiators finally brought home a revised NAFTA deal, it included only minimal changes, some of them not for the better. And this deal, now largely upstaged by the high drama of Trump’s Great Wall, is likely to be rejected by Congress.

Trump also raised tariffs on steel and aluminum, less as part of a coherent global trade policy than as a way of currying favor with two key industries concentrated in key swing states and pursuing some allies in the industrial unions. This move did help domestic production, though it drew fire for increasing costs in industries that use steel and aluminum. (In fact, according to Michael Wessel, the costs are about $75 per vehicle for steel and 2 cents for an aluminum six-pack of beer.)

Because the targets of his tariffs included much of Europe as well as genuinely protectionist economies such as China (which is responsible for approximately half the world’s excess steel capacity), the policy ended up annoying allies. And because a coherent strategy of economic nationalism would require companion industrial policies to rebuild domestic industry coupled with serious public-infrastructure investment that would also create millions of blue-collar jobs, Trump’s gestures fell light-years short of engendering an industrial rebirth.

With his China policy, however, Trump hit pay dirt. China’s mercantilist system, as well as specific abuses such as cyber theft and the pilfering of trade secrets, really does cry out for a muscular U.S. response. Trump also hit pay dirt when he hired Lighthizer, the rare exception to the trade representatives of the four preceding U.S. administrations that were gulled by Beijing. The two men had not known each other, but to the economic nationalists around Trump, including Dan DiMicco, former president of Nucor Steel and Trump’s trade adviser in the campaign, who knew Lighthizer from several cases protesting China’s dumping of low-cost, state-subsidized steel on the U.S. and world markets, Lighthizer was the natural pick.

James Mann observes, “Trump’s is the first U.S. administration that wants something from China that’s about China itself and its own economic system, not about other things like help with the Cold War or climate change.”

As Mann explains it, under Nixon and Kissinger, the U.S. wanted a closer relationship with China as a counterweight to the USSR. Under Clinton, we assumed that changes in China’s internal economic and political systems would logically follow if we let them into the WTO, so Clinton put aside concerns about human-rights abuses in China. Under George W. Bush, we needed China’s acquiescence in the U.N. Security Council to our Iraq invasion. Under Obama, the main thing we wanted from China was some progress on climate—and our main trade goal for the region, the aborted TPP, did not address China’s own predatory trade practices. China has been brilliant at giving the U.S. some of the things that Washington asks for that do not affect its economic or political system. With Trump and Lighthizer, that has changed.

Ever since the U.S. welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, based on Beijing’s vague promises to behave like a normal market economy, China has been taking advantage of America’s naïve belief that more trade would somehow transform China into a liberal and democratic market economy. In fact, of course, the Chinese Communist Party is more firmly in charge today than ever. Political liberties are shrinking, not growing. China remains an economy of state-led capitalism, which resorts to tactics that violate both the letter and the sprit of liberal trade. The state, moreover, is controlled by a Leninist party that tolerates no political openness or dissent.

Naïveté is probably too kind a characterization of the posture of U.S. corporate, financial, and political elites. Willful blindness is more accurate. While some American manufacturing companies were mightily upset at being displaced by Chinese firms, many others were content to move operations to China, where wages were low, workers repressed, and billion-dollar construction subsidies were on offer for the factories they sought to build. The financial industry was not able to operate freely inside China, but was bought off by being able to make billions brokering deals. So Wall Street was a passionate backer of the status quo, too.

In the 1990s, when China was pressing for admission to the WTO on terms that would still allow it to subsidize and protect its domestic industry as a “developing country,” Beijing was playing a weak diplomatic hand. China was in ill repute from the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square. In key industries, productivity levels lagged those of the West, and China was far from fully competitive.

In Bill Clinton, China faced an American president who had campaigned on human rights. Clinton took office insisting that China had to improve its human-rights record before being admitted to the WTO. Once in office, however, Clinton succumbed to business pressure that craved access to China’s market of 1.2 billion people. Clinton’s story line became that China’s WTO membership would inevitably lead to more liberalization, both politically and economically.

Having secured its coveted WTO membership, China then ignored its vague commitments to liberalize. Instead, Beijing went right on building a toweringly successful mercantilist economy and, under Xi, ratcheting up its dictatorship. Its practices were hidden in plain view. They are spelled out in the voluminous annual reports of the U.S.-China Commission, and in the annual reports of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in countless complaints filed by American companies, and in a growing library of revisionist books.

Today, 17 years into China’s WTO membership and commitments to liberalize, all of its major industries are either owned or directed by the government, which is to say the Communist Party. State-owned or -controlled enterprises get cheap or free capital—sometimes outright grants, sometimes loans at below-market or negative interest rates, often both. The state doesn’t care whether these enterprises lose money for a long time so long as they create, borrow, or steal key technologies and gain global market share. China imports only what it needs—mostly food, raw materials, and some advanced capital goods, but not products that would compete with its own domestic producers, except to the extent that it needs to throw the West an occasional bone to undercut the influence of trade hawks.

China steals technology from the West, either by copying and reverse-engineering it, or by requiring coercive “partnerships” with Western companies that seek to do business in China. In a typical deal, the American company is attracted by subsidies to build plants and by cheap labor. But in return, the company must agree to produce only for export back to the West, and to share its advanced technology with a Chinese partner whose goal is to overtake and displace the Western rival over time. China’s immense trade surpluses with the West are augmented by its practices of currency manipulation, but this is secondary. What’s primary is China’s entire system of state-led mercantilism.

The rise of China is an unmistakable geo-economic, geopolitical, and ideological threat to the United States. Yet four presidents, two Republicans and two Democrats, from George H.W. Bush through Barack Obama, indulged Beijing. Looking back, the reason seems to be one part wishful thinking, one part the fact that so many American interests and notables were making so much money despite the long-term damage to the U.S. economy, and one part confusion about the meaning and the dynamics of “free trade.”

To American elites, the U.S. is selling the world a system of free-market capitalism. To resort to measures like tariffs, even as leverage against countries that routinely violate the norms and rules of market capitalism, would somehow be “protectionist.” Moreover, markets should dictate the location of global production (never mind that China’s capture of global market share is far from a free-market verdict.) Therefore, to care about whether U.S.-based companies produce domestically, except on the narrowest of national-security grounds, is to practice odious economic nationalism, a habit that we are seeking to dissuade other nations from indulging. And just to reinforce this self-annihilating set of syllogisms, scores of former top U.S. trade and diplomatic officials, as well as scholars, have lucrative consulting arrangements with the Chinese, and can be counted upon to lecture on the dangers of protectionism and China-bashing.

The mainstream press also got China completely wrong, and for the most part, it still does. One big mistake was to assume that partial economic opening would inexorably lead to political pluralism. In The New York Times, Nicholas Kristof wrote in 2004 that “after the Chinese could watch Eddie Murphy, wear tight pink dresses and struggle over what to order at Starbucks, the revolution was finished. No middle class is content with more choices of coffees than of candidates on a ballot.”

The more recent mistake of much press coverage has been to confuse tactics with goals. A standard news story might be characterized as, Oh My God, Tariffs! In general, the hard line taken by Lighthizer and Trump has gotten a hostile press.

While establishment China scholars are now in a mood of revise and repent, they continue to resist the kind of aggressive diplomacy that would make a real difference—perhaps because its instigator is Donald Trump. Last March in Foreign Affairs, the bible of the foreign-policy elite, Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs under Obama, wrote a kind of nostra culpa piece with Ely Ratner titled “The China Reckoning,” admitting that “the assumptions driving U.S. China policy look increasingly tenuous.” Yet the piece went on to warn against Trump’s approach, which risks “being confrontational without being competitive.”

One amusing and instructive misinterpretation occurred when Trump, with Lighthizer by his side, called in the press and the cameras on February 22, to discuss progress on the China negotiations. At one point, with China’s top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, looking on, Trump directed Lighthizer not to settle for a mere “memorandum of understanding” in any China deal, but to insist on a binding contract. Lighthizer explained to his boss that in trade law, a memorandum of understanding is a contract. To most of the media, the takeaway was that Trump was an idiot, both for having this conversation in front of both the press and the chief Chinese negotiator and for misunderstanding the terminology. But in Trump’s world of real-estate deals, such memoranda are far from binding and easily evaded. In context, Trump was posturing tough, telling his negotiator not to get rolled. To the extent that Trump really meant it, he had learned well from Lighthizer. With Trump, of course, you never know.

AP Photo/Donald Stampfli Ever since the U.S. welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has been taking advantage of America’s naïve belief that more trade would somehow transform China into a liberal and democratic market economy. Here, Chinese officials await the opening of the WTO's general council meeting in Geneva in December 2001.

Negotiating with China recalls the famous serenity prayer of Alcoholics Anonymous: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

There are some aspects of China’s economic system that are purely China’s affair—that American pressure cannot change, and probably should not try. Western observers thought that exposure to the world economy would inexorably push China toward more economic and political liberalism. They were disastrously wrong. And if China wants to have a system of state-led capitalism, with subsidies and industrial policies, that is China’s business. The system has succeeded in generating rates of economic growth at a scale unmatched in the history of the world, and is responsible for relieving hundreds of millions of people of extreme poverty.

If the U.S. disdains industrial policies, while China targets the next generation of advanced technology, from artificial intelligence to 5G broadband, under its Made in China 2025 program, China’s resulting dominance will be mainly the result of America’s own stupidity. However, real U.S. national (and working- and middle-class) security requires that we define cutting-edge technologies broadly, rather than narrowly in military terms. And we should make sure China does not get an unfair leg up by purchasing American advanced-technology companies, or placing state-controlled companies like ZTE or Huawei in the heart of America’s communications infrastructure. (Alas, Trump’s continued affronts to America’s allies have made them unreceptive to demands that they keep Huawei out of their telecom infrastructure, and Trump himself has hinted that he might go easier on ZTE as part of a grand bargain.)

China has the right to its own model, but the model becomes problematic when its mercantilism includes theft, commercial espionage, and disdain for intellectual-property rights, and results in the displacement of entire U.S. industries through tactics that are illegal under the WTO, or should be. Former Missouri Senator Jim Talent, one of the Republicans on the U.S.-China Commission, told me, “We thought that by letting them into the world trading system, we would change them. But they’ve changed the system. The WTO tools are inadequate to deal with an economy like China. The WTO presumes that a major actor is not actively trying to subvert the entire system.”

If the WTO is an inadequate venue of redress, then the U.S. is entirely within its rights to pursue unilateral remedies in search of some kind of modus vivendi with Beijing. Before he rejoined the government, Lighthizer called for unilateral measures to protect American interests, even if they are inconsistent with WTO commitments (which China repeatedly ignores). “WTO commitments are not religious obligations,” he told the U.S.-China Commission, [and] “do not (and should not be construed to) impinge upon national sovereignty, and are not subject to coercion by some WTO police force.”

The U.S. has the power to prevent China from buying strategically important companies, which we have used intermittently through CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. We have the power to create our own industrial policies, and to strengthen “buy American” requirements. Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb introduced a bill to prohibit American companies from transferring to Chinese “partners” technologies created thanks to government contracts or R&D. The U.S.-China Trade Commission has called for a mandatory reporting system for all technology transferred to China.

Lighthizer has also raised the possibility of using tariffs not just as bargaining counters, but to offset the overall impact of China’s mercantilist system. “At some point, however,” he told the commission, “where goods imports from China exceed $300 billion while U.S. exports to China are below $70 billion—one must ask whether potential retaliation from China really would or could even remotely offset the benefits to the United States of more aggressive trade measures.” Advocating a policy that runs counter to those of every other recent administration, Lighthizer has also called for China to be formally designated as a currency manipulator, which would permit the levying of still other offsetting (“countervailing”) tariffs.

Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, Lighthizer walked a tightrope between professing loyalty to Trump and insisting that the China deal was far from done. “Much needs to be done both before an agreement is reached, and more importantly, after it is reached, if it is reached.” He added that the U.S. would reserve the right to resort to unilateral measures, if those were required by China’s behavior. As a key element of the evolving agreement, Lighthizer described a complex system of multi-tiered consultations to resolve complaints of violations of the deal—on a monthly basis with lower-level officials from both countries, then quarterly with more senior officials, and finally every six months with Lighthizer and China’s vice premier and special envoy on trade, Liu He. In the absence of binding commitments for structural change, this system could easily turn into more of the same stuff.

Psychotherapists often counsel patients that you can’t change someone else’s behavior, only your own; by doing that, you alter the system. The same might be said of trade diplomacy. With the multilateral WTO next to useless, and China resisting making concessions in two-way talks, some unilateral policies make sense in their own right. We are not going to change China’s entire economic model, but that model does not require cyber theft. It does not require coercive terms for Western companies to operate within China. It’s also reasonable for the U.S. to demand a set of trading practices that takes into account and offsets China’s extensive strategies of state subsidies and selling below cost that are counter to norms of liberal trade. The use of tariffs to counterbalance such policies is both reasonable and sensible.

The risk of the wrong sort of deal with China is twofold. First, China’s nominal commitments to revise some mercantilist practices can and will be easily evaded, as they have been ever since China was let into the WTO. The more serious risk is that in exchange for China’s agreements to import more products, the U.S. may swear off the use of unilateral measures that could really make a difference by insulating our economy from China’s predatory practices.

Under Lighthizer’s predecessors, most of whom were lobbyists or investment bankers, USTR reports on China read like exercises in gentle persuasion: We thank China for making some progress. Now, could China please make some more progress? Under Lighthizer, they read like indictments.

With tough and creative diplomacy, it is possible both to allow China its own development model and to prevent China from breaking the rules and thriving at America’s expense. Lighthizer has the wisdom and courage to pursue such policies. Whether his boss does remains to be seen.",0,0,0,https://prospect.org/article/trumps-one-good-appointee
cnn,Senate investigators pursue Moscow-based former Trump associate,"London and Moscow (CNN) Senate investigators want to question a Moscow-based American businessman with longstanding ties to President Donald Trump after witnesses told them he could shed light on the President's commercial and personal activities in Russia dating back to the 1990s, multiple sources have told CNN.

The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is probing allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 elections, has been keen to speak with David Geovanis for several months, the sources say.

Geovanis helped organize a 1996 trip to Moscow by Trump, who was in the early stages of pursuing what would become a long-held goal of building a Trump Tower in the Russian capital, according to multiple media reports at the time.

Years later, Geovanis worked for the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, whose ties to Trump's 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort have also been of interest to investigators.

Two witnesses who have given evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee say they were asked about Geovanis' past relationship with the President during interviews last year. The interviews were conducted by staff working for both the Republican and Democratic sides of the committee, according to the sources, who wish to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the Senate inquiry.

This is the first time that Geovanis' name has been revealed in connection with the various investigations underway into Russian influence on US politics, which include a sweeping new House investigation into Trump's financial interests.

The Senate Intelligence Committee's interest in Geovanis indicates its investigation is delving further back into Trump's past in Russia than previously thought.

One of the two witnesses says the committee has a photograph of a younger Geovanis apparently posing in a portrait with three partially clothed women. The portrait, once displayed in a Russian gallery under the title ""The Capitalist,"" depicts the subjects in front of a picture of the former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. It's not clear whether the portrait is a single photograph or a composite.

The witness told CNN that they were shown the photograph during questioning.

A third witness has alleged in written testimony, seen by CNN, that Geovanis may be valuable in the mystery of whether Russia has material on Trump that could be personally embarrassing to him.

Known by the nickname ""Geo"" to his friends, Geovanis was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, and is a graduate of Trump's alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After starting his career in finance, Geovanis went to Moscow to work for a Russian venture of a company called Brooke Group, which owned land earmarked for the site of a proposed Trump Tower. When Trump came to town to promote the project, sources say, it was Geovanis' job to show him around.

Also on the trip were Brooke Group's owners, the real estate moguls Bennett LeBow and Howard Lorber, who went on to become substantial donors to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump personally acknowledged the pair from the podium after he won the 2016 New York Republican primary.

An archive video report of Trump's 1996 Moscow trip emerged online in late January. The news report -- misidentified on YouTube as dating from 1995 -- shows Lorber, Lebow and Trump in discussion with Moscow's then deputy mayor, Vladimir Resin, and his staff, with Geovanis looking on from the background.

Blocked numbers and 'dirt' on Clinton

Lorber has already been linked to the Senate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. The New York Times named him earlier this month as one of the Trump family associates who spoke with Donald Trump Jr. from blocked numbers around the time of a highly scrutinized 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York.

That meeting was attended by top Trump campaign advisers --- Trump Jr., the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Manafort -- and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskya, who had promised dirt on Trump's election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Lorber has not responded to multiple calls for comment.

When contacted by CNN via telephone, Geovanis declined to comment on his relationship with the President or talk about the photograph said to be in the possession of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He would not disclose his location, although CNN was able to confirm he was in the Moscow area as recently as this month. Asked whether he had been approached by the committee and whether he was aware of its interest, Geovanis told CNN he had ""no comment.""

A spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee's Republican chairman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, declined to comment on whether Geovanis was of interest to it. A spokeswoman for the committee's Democratic Vice Chair, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, also declined to comment.

It's not known whether Geovanis is also of interest to the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The President's legal team declined to comment on his relationship to Geovanis. A lawyer for the Trump Organization also declined to comment.

A tower that never got built

Geovanis was quoted by the Moscow Times in 1996 as saying officials were ""very receptive"" to the original Trump Tower project, but Trump's early designs on the Moscow skyline never got off the ground.

Discussions two decades later to build another Trump Tower in the Russian capital have been a focal point in the Mueller investigation.

Trump has often denied that his dealings with Russia continued into the 2016 campaign. Even in late 2018 Trump tweeted he ""never met a single Russian official.""

It is not clear what prompted the Senate Intelligence Committee's interest in Geovanis. But multiple sources familiar with its activities tell CNN their inquiries date back to spring last year when it sent him a letter requesting he give evidence. The sources say he has not yet done so but added that he had appointed US legal counsel.

Lebow and Lorber changed their company name from Brooke Group to Vector Group, a Nasdaq-listed cigarette and real estate company. Vector Group's top three shareholders include Renaissance Technologies, the hedge fund once run by Robert Mercer, the conservative donor who was once a patron of business and political ventures of Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist.

A spokeswoman for Vector did not reply to CNN's emails requesting comment. A fax to BSL Capital, Lebow's family firm, went unanswered, despite an assistant confirming it had been received.

Geovanis, who married a Russian woman, obtained a Russian passport in 2014. He was last seen by family members in the US in early 2017 after the death of his mother.

He is not believed to have returned to the US since then, and his decision to remain in Moscow means US congressional investigators can't easily find out what he knows.

In 2017 Geovanis was reemployed by Lebow to set up the Russian arm of another venture, Somerset Coal International, an energy technology company which claims to ""clean"" coal by washing it at high pressure.

Among those approached by Geovanis for investment was Deripaska, the billionaire metals and mining magnate, for whom Geovanis worked in the mid-2000s, according to a person familiar with Somerset Coal's business plan, speaking on condition of anonymity.

A spokesperson for Deripaska did not return CNN's requests for comment.",2019,02,21,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/politics/senate-trump-russia-david-geovanis-intl/index.html

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Michael Cohen named names from the Trump Organization during his public testimony before Congress. And now lawmakers have questions for those people.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

They want to follow up on exchanges like this with the president's former lawyer. Representative Jackie Speier asked Cohen about Donald Trump's involvement in building a Trump Tower Moscow.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JACKIE SPEIER: Did Mr. Trump tell you to offer Vladimir Putin a free penthouse?

MICHAEL COHEN: No, ma'am.

SPEIER: So what was that...

COHEN: That was Felix Sater. It was a marketing stunt.

INSKEEP: There's a name. Felix Sater - longtime New York real estate developer and past associate of the president. During testimony like that, Elijah Cummings was presiding. He gestured at times while casually holding his gavel up between his fingers. And now Cummings, along with the head of the House Intelligence Committee, says he's planning to call more witnesses such as Sater.

MARTIN: So NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell's been following all this and joins us now.

Good morning, Kelsey.

KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So Michael Cohen seems to have given Democrats, in particular, a whole lot of grist for their mill. They are reportedly going to call Felix Sater and others to come testify. What do they want to learn?

SNELL: Yeah. This is part of a broader strategy that we saw on display a little bit in that open Cohen hearing earlier this week. And they want to build a chain of information, which is kind of what we heard starting in that bit with Speier. Every time Cohen said he didn't have an answer for a question, they asked who in Trump's inner circle did have the answer. And that's when we heard names like Allen Weisselberg, the CFO of the Trump Organization, and David Pecker from the National Enquirer and even possibly Donald Trump Jr.

Now we're seeing them follow through. And what that - the first time we're seeing that is with Sater. In his case, it seems they want to know more about how plans for Trump Tower in Moscow came together. In particular, some members seem very interested in how involved Trump himself was and if that involvement lasted after he was elected and if it involved cutting deals with high-ranking Russian officials. So that is likely where they're headed.

MARTIN: So Cohen is also coming back. I mean, he's coming back again for a closed session next week with House intel - the intel committee. Adam Schiff, the chairman of that committee, saying that his - that they want - what they didn't get this week, what more, possibly, could Michael Cohen provide?

SNELL: Well, it's important to remember that the intel committee has a really different focus from the oversight committee, where Cohen was giving that public testimony that we just heard. Oversight is interested in Trump's domestic dealings, things like, you know, the way that he made money and what he did here in the U.S. Intel - they really just care about his interactions with Russia and other foreign entities. And that's part of the reason that their interviews are behind closed doors. It allows the committee to get into classified information and go down paths that relate to the Mueller investigation - all stuff that isn't public yet. So Schiff did say he'd like to make as much of the Sater interview public as possible. But Cohen, we think, should still remain behind closed doors.

MARTIN: Interesting. So before I let you go, I want to...

SNELL: Yeah.

MARTIN: ...Ask you about this report that came out. The New York Times and The Washington Post both reporting that President Trump allegedly ordered top-secret security clearance for his son-in-law Jared Kushner and that he did this over the strong recommendation of White House counsel Don McGahn and his chief of staff at the time, right?

SNELL: Right. So The Times is reporting that Trump ordered his then chief of staff John Kelly to give Kushner the top-secret security clearances. And it was a decision that overruled the assessment of the intelligence community. And they're basing this on what they say is at least one contemporaneous memo. Now, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders is quoted as saying that the White House does not comment on clearances. But it's already sparked some attention from Democrats. And Elijah Cummings, who we already talked about - the oversight committee chairman - already launched an investigation into security clearances. And late last night, he's demanded that the White House comply with his demands for documents and information.

MARTIN: OK, NPR's Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thank you. We appreciate it.

SNELL: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MARTIN: President Trump says he walked away from a potential deal with North Korea because the North wanted all U.S. sanctions lifted. Here's what he said to Sean Hannity on Fox News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They wanted to de-nuke certain areas. And I wanted everything. And the sanctions are there. And I didn't want to give up the sanctions unless we had a real program.

INSKEEP: Now, North Korea's foreign minister is giving a different account of this failed summit. He says the North only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for shutting down some nuclear sites and insists the North offered a good deal. Well, how did all this look to North Korea's neighbors, South Korea and China?

MARTIN: Let's ask NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz. He has been monitoring the reaction around the region.

Good morning, Rob.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.

MARTIN: So let's start with South Korea - right? - because they have (laughter) the most to win or lose by a potential nuclear deal. I mean, what's just been the reaction in the past 24 hours?

SCHMITZ: Well, I think for South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, this outcome puts him in a very difficult spot. You know, he's worked really hard in the past year guiding a sort of a forward momentum with Kim Jong Un. And this has got to be pretty deflating for him. I spoke with John Delury, who's an associate professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies, about this. And here's what he said about how South Korea's feeling right now.

JOHN DELURY: The government here really wanted to see more tangible results. I think they would've been happy with what's been called a small deal and some interim steps, you know, to sustain this momentum. So to just kind of walk away with nothing is not good.

MARTIN: And what about China?

SCHMITZ: Well, in terms of North Korea, Beijing is likely to be fine with the fact that no deal was reached. China's leadership prefers the status quo. North Korea remains a mildly threatening buffer state between China and U.S. troops in South Korea. And a lack of a nuclear agreement keeps North Korea in play when it comes to U.S.-China relations. In other words, Beijing can continue to use its close relationship with North Korea as currency in its negotiations with the U.S. Now, there's another thing that Beijing is likely paying close attention to here. And that's the fact that President Trump walked away from a potential deal.

Like North Korea, China's leadership has also been made to believe that they're about to sign a deal with President Trump to end a trade war. Knowing that the president's capable of just walking away like this may give China's leaders pause for thought as they approach an upcoming summit between Xi Jinping and Trump. You know, will Trump do the same thing if he's not satisfied with them? This trade war has been pretty debilitating for China's economy, so they're not going to want a repeat of what just happened in Hanoi when they meet with Trump later this month.

MARTIN: Right. Meanwhile, North Korea is insisting - they've got a different view of how the negotiations actually broke down and that, by the way, their position is never going to change. So where does that leave the future of these negotiations?

SCHMITZ: Yeah. It's interesting to watch the - or look at the North Korean media spin all of this. Remarkable progress was one of their headlines after this summit (laughter). They pointed out that Kim and Trump have a very special relationship and that they'll keep working on that. You know, I think one thing to remember here is that Kim Jong Un is still in Vietnam right now. He's still visiting with that country's leaders. And this could be an important country for the type of future that Kim is trying to build for North Korea, which is more economically connected within the region. It's also a long train home ride for Kim. So he's going to make a lot of stops on the way in China, perhaps, including another meeting, maybe, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, turning this trip into more of a regional tour.

MARTIN: OK. NPR's Rob Schmitz, thanks so much.

SCHMITZ: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MARTIN: Michael Jackson was everything to so many people - a child prodigy who became an icon. He was the King of Pop. But for the past 25 years, there's been this horrible shadow over his legacy, which is now the subject of a new documentary.

INSKEEP: Two men come forward in that documentary, which is titled ""Leaving Neverland."" It airs on HBO this weekend. In this film, Wade Robson and James Safechuck claim that the singer sexually abused them starting around the ages of 7 and 10. They say the abuse went on for years. Michael Jackson's family has been responding to the film. And here's what his nephew Taj told CBS.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TAJ JACKSON: It's always been about money. I hate to say it. When it's my uncle, it's almost like they see a blank check.

INSKEEP: The Jackson estate is suing HBO, calling the documentary a posthumous character assassination.

MARTIN: We've got NPR TV critic Eric Deggans with us this morning. Hey, Eric.

ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So Jackson - Michael Jackson has been charged and acquitted of child molestation in the past. What makes this documentary and these accusations different?

DEGGANS: Well, this is a detailed look at allegations from Robson and Safechuck, two men who spent many years with Jackson's children and who had once denied that the singer ever abused them. The film centers on these in-depth interviews with them. It includes their mothers, their wives, a few other relatives. Robson met Jackson when he was 5 or so in 1987 after winning a dance contest in Australia, where he was born. And Safechuck started - Safechuck starred in a 1986 Pepsi commercial with Jackson. And both of these men say that Jackson built friendships with them and their families. When he was at the height of his fame, he showered gifts and attention on them while he was secretly abusing them sexually when they were isolated.

MARTIN: So we heard Jackson's nephew argue that this is always all about money. It always has been when it comes to his uncle. How are the filmmakers responding?

DEGGANS: Well, Jackson's family also notes that the filmmakers didn't ask them for comment in the film. And that's a big issue with critics of ""Leaving Neverland."" Jackson died in 2009, so he's not around to respond to these allegations himself. The film's director, Dan Reed, has said that he wanted to focus on the only people who could actually know what happened between Jackson, Robson and Safechuck. I do think another recent documentary that looked at abuse allegations against a music star, Lifetime's ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" showed how interviewing a lot of people, including former employees or even psychologists, could add new context to allegations like this and give you a fuller picture.

MARTIN: So, Eric, you've seen this. I mean, I'm a Michael Jackson fan. I grew up with his music.

DEGGANS: I know.

MARTIN: I know you're a Michael Jackson fan, to say the least.

DEGGANS: For sure.

MARTIN: So what is it - how's this going to change how we think about his music?

DEGGANS: Well, it could change it quite a lot, depending on how much people believe these allegations that are told by Robson and Safechuck. I mean, we're now at a time after Cosby, after Louis C.K., after R. Kelly's arrest, where people are looking back at celebrities who may have avoided consequences for serious wrongdoing in the past. And they're kind of re-evaluating the original allegations against them. Now, you know, Jackson was acquitted on child molestation charges. He's not around to speak to these allegations. But I do think a film like ""Leaving Neverland"" will push some fans to re-examine past stories about his closeness to children and decide for themselves how comfortable they are listening to his music and supporting his legacy.

MARTIN: NPR TV critic Eric Deggans for us this morning. Eric, thanks. We appreciate it.

DEGGANS: Thank you.

cnn,"Group running robocalls impersonating Trump's campaign has already raised more than $100,000","(CNN) The call sounds like it is coming from President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.

It even uses a recording of the President's voice: ""I'm Donald Trump. Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border, out of love and devotion to our country."" A deep-voiced narrator then comes on asking the listener to ""be one of the hundreds thousands of patriots that helped President Trump finally build a the wall by making a one-time urgently needed donation to the campaign.""

Calls like this one, said to number more than 200,000, have helped raise more than $100,000 in January alone, but that money isn't going to the Trump campaign, whose spokesperson told CNN they were not affiliated with the calls. Instead, the calls are coming from a political action committee that isn't affiliated with Trump's re-election effort and hasn't spent any money so far in this or last election cycle, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.

A CNN KFile investigation into the group behind the calls, Support American Leaders PAC, reveals it is run by 32-year-old Matthew Tunstall, who has a history of managing shadowy groups that target people with politically charged calls in order to raise money while doing very little -- if anything at all -- to put that money toward a political purpose. Tunstall made more than $300,000 through these groups in the 2016 presidential cycle, FEC records show.

The operation effectively amounts to an income cycle of wash, rinse, repeat: paying for ads to raise money to pay for more ads to raise more money and so on, with Tunstall taking home whatever money doesn't get used to pay for more ads. The enterprise may also be breaking spending rules policed by three different federal agencies on impersonation and ad disclosure.

Determining who was behind the calls was difficult. The recorded calls come from non-working numbers, do not identify the group responsible for them or provide a callback number. And when KFile reached multiple call center operators working for the group, they each provided the name of a PAC that does not exist.

Those practices appear to be in violation of Federal Trade Commission, Federal Election Commission and Federal Communications Commission rules on impersonation and requiring ads disclose the name of the organization making the calls.

In response to written questions from CNN, Tunstall claimed the calls followed required rules and said any calls beginning with ""I'm Donald Trump"" were the results of technical errors and that such calls were ceased following CNN's inquiry.

""This was a technical error if you heard this, there were many different variants that have been recently tested for different political ads regarding support for President Trump,"" Tunstall wrote CNN in an email. ""I've been instructed by multiple legal sources that using voice clips from politicians is acceptable and not considered 'impersonating' because politicians are public officials and do not have rights to their likeness like normal private citizens and celebrities do.""

History of playing both sides

Tunstall has a history of managing PACs that targeted conservative and liberal ends of the political spectrum. During the 2016 presidential election campaign, BuzzFeed reported that Tunstall was behind both Progressive Priorities PAC , a group that claimed to support Hillary Clinton & Bernie Sanders and the Democrats' agenda, and Liberty Action Group , which claimed to support Trump.

Nearly all of the money donated to both groups went to paying for radio ad and calls that solicited more donations, or to Tunstall and unspecified media consultants. According to FEC records, the groups did not donate to any actual candidates.

CNN's KFile reported in 2017 that Liberty Action Group raised nearly $3 million through radio ads and robocalls during the 2016 election by asking for contributions to help elect Trump, with Tunstall himself being paid more than $300,000.

Liberty Action Group used former presidential candidate Ben Carson's name without his consent on fundraising appeals in 2016, asking voters to sign a pledge they claimed was signed by Carson to support Trump.

In 2016 , the group was sued by a San Francisco man who said they illegally placed robocalls to his cell phone causing him to incur unwanted charges. Court records show the case was settled.

KFile also reported that in early 2017, several people received phone calls from Progressive Priorities PAC that played a recording of former President Barack Obama followed by a request to donate to ""help Obama impeach Trump."" A spokesperson for the former president told CNN's KFile at the time those calls were reported to law enforcement.

Unchanged practices

Despite past reporting, Tunstall doesn't seem to have changed his ways, but he claims his ads never intended to impersonate anyone and claims this time around he plans to spent the money to support candidates like President Trump.

""Regarding impersonation, Support American Leaders PAC has never willfully intended to do anything other than comply with the FEC regulations and support candidates like President Trump. Support American Leaders PAC is not the Trump campaign or affiliated with the Trump campaign,"" he added.

But recorded robocalls reviewed by CNN's KFILE and calls and data obtained from Nomorobo, a company with a widely used application to stop robocalls on cell phones and landlines, show Support American Leaders PAC did not have any required disclosures on their calls. Calls from Support American Leaders PAC began with clips of Trump and ended asking for callers to either connect with a call operator or unsubscribe.

CNN's KFile first discovered the calls on the Nomorobo website , which tracks robocalls through the 250,000 phone lines they own in order to block them on their application. In calls sent to phone numbers owned by Nomorobo, 1,688 calls received on 545 different lines, not a single instance recorded included a disclaimer of who was behind the calls.

An FEC spokesperson told KFile that they require that telephone solicitations by a candidate's campaign or a committee, ""must include a clear disclaimer identifying the name of the committee that paid for the communication."" Communications not sent by a committee authorized for a federal candidate must have a disclaimer that must ""state the name of the committee paying for it and whether or not it was authorized by a federal candidate.""

The FEC also prohibits fundraising that misrepresents ""the person as speaking, writing, or otherwise acting for or on behalf of any candidate.""

The FCC requires any pre-recorded political robocalls to identify the name of the committee behind the calls at the beginning of the message and a callback number must be provided either during or after the message. Section Five of the Federal Trade Commission Act bars deceptive practices in commerce when ""a representation, omission, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer.""

Despite this, Tunstall claimed his calls featured the required disclosure and said he made more than 200,000 calls.

""I can't comment on how much of the recording Nomorobo was able to record, but the name of the PAC and also the required phone number are at the end of the recording per FEC regulations for political voice broadcasts,"" he said. ""200,000 calls were placed with different message variants for the pre-launch test, and in the coming months, we plan to reach over five million voters combined between radio, television, and phone calls.""

Professor Richard Hasen, a University of California, Irvine professor of law and political science, says that Tunstall may be opening himself up to criminal penalties if his actions were intentional.

""Willful violations of federal campaign laws can subject someone to criminal liability in addition to civil penalties,"" Hasen told CNN.

Hasen pointed to an example of a GOP donor who was indicted earlier this month for using his super PAC to funnel more than $1 million in contributions to himself.

Tunstall and his PAC aren't easy to find

Because of the lack of disclosure in the robocalls, the PAC could only be reached by being connected with an operator if you received a call and pressing a number when prompted. Nomorobo had incoming calls from numbers associated with the PAC forwarded to the cellphone of a reporter for CNN.

Operators in call centers repeatedly told KFile in four calls that the group making the call was the Trump campaign. When pressed, operators said the money was going to Conservative Leaders PAC, a non-existent PAC. KFile only discovered the real name of the organization by making a donation to the group with a pre-paid debit card.

The transaction was charged as ""Support Trump"" through Rally, a payment processor used for fundraising solicitations. Rally, which informs donors where their money goes when asked, told CNN the money went to Support American Leaders PAC -- a PAC registered with the FEC.

Tunstall is the only name on paperwork for the group and a phone number listed for the PAC was previously not a working number.

Following an inquiry, Rally told CNN's KFile the processor had suspended Support American Leaders PAC based on previous reports on Tunstall.

Tunstall told CNN that call center operators were told to give the name of correct PAC and that the error was the result of incorrect scripts.

""The call center agents are trained to say that the contribution goes to helping Support American Leaders PAC, re-elect President Trump and support his agenda, which is true,"" he said. ""The initial testing is still in the pre-stage where call center agents are still getting used to the scripting. This was an error or something that isn't on the script if you heard this. Agents are instructed to state the disclaimer at the end of the call per FEC regulations which is, 'This call was paid and authorized by Support American Leaders PAC. Contributions made are not tax deductible for income tax purposes.'""

Tunstall declined to give CNN the name of his call centers when asked.

For an organization without a website or any media attention, FEC records show Support American Leaders PAC raised $114,240 in January . But the records don't show any individual donations; instead the group lists only one donation for the entire amount raised as coming from a group called ""Support America.""

Tunstall could not say what ""Support America"" was on his FEC records.

""Donor information is only required for donations over $200 and we used best efforts and are still using efforts to collect the occupation and employer for these donors,"" Tunstall told CNN when asked about the lack of individual donors listed. ""'Support America' might be the payment processor descriptor, or a check by mail donation.""",2019,02,28,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/kfile-investigation-robocalls/index.html
politico,How Vietnam Became Donald Trump’s Forever War,"Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.

For Donald Trump, Vietnam never ended.

Conventional wisdom says Trump sluiced through the fractious late 1960s relatively unmoved, shirt-and-tie focused on the family’s real estate business and trying to turn his father’s wealth into some of his own. Even now, at the start of his third year as president, and heading to Hanoi for his second summit with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un, conversations about Trump and Vietnam typically start and finish with how he skirted getting drafted, or what he said about John McCain, or perhaps his habit of likening his sexual promiscuity to the dangers of combat.

Story Continued Below

But over the years, as the United States as a whole struggled to move on from the psychological trauma of his generation’s signature conflict, Trump did not let go of Vietnam. In his invocations of the place, the war and its resonance as a fissure in modern American history, Trump has mined a rich and useful vein, presenting himself variously as charitable, virile, lucky and tough. But more than even that, Trump has deployed Vietnam as a bedrock tenet of his rudimentary worldview: We don’t win anymore.

“Weakness,” Tony Schwartz, who spent hundreds of hours with Trump while writing the words for The Art of the Deal, told me, “is Trump’s greatest fear.” As such, in the estimation of Schwartz, the takeaway of the war in Vietnam was viscerally unsettling, “his worst fear writ large—that the enemy, with far less money and resources, would figure out a way to outwit the Goliath.” In this telling, the Goliath is the U.S., but Trump himself, too—and the humbling retreat in 1975 was not only a national wound, Schwartz suggested, but a personal affront. And over time he has turned that grievance into an appeal that clicked with a constituency that shared his frustration. “He is always trolling for sore spots, unresolved issues, places to egg on grudges and resentments,” biographer Gwenda Blair told me, “and Vietnam is no exception.”

Trump graduated from college at the utter apex of the war. The day of his 1968 commencement at the Wharton business school, at the University of Pennsylvania, 40 American soldiers were killed. That year would become the bloodiest of the war. More than half a million of his peers were fighting in Vietnam. Trump, 22, fit and strong, didn’t join them. He “wasn’t a fan of the Vietnam War,” and he also “wasn’t a marcher,” he has said. “I had other things to do.” He has often cited the fortune of a high draft lottery number, but that’s not the reason he didn’t go; the lottery didn’t even begin until December 1969. Trump didn’t go, like many men his age, because of four education deferments—and then, more consequentially, a medical deferment in the fall of ‘68 due to a since-much-discussed set of heel spurs. In any event, while a Princeton-educated lieutenant named Robert Swan Mueller III was leading a platoon of Marines in the thick of searing combat, Trump was back in his father’s office in Brooklyn, collecting rent and planning his move to Manhattan.

“Trump was AWOL from the Vietnam generation. He didn’t protest in the streets of America or go to Southeast Asia,” presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told me. This, however, Brinkley quickly added, did not mean Trump was unaware of what was happening. The country seemed to be cleaving into two, and President Richard Nixon remained popular at the time, and those two things were not unrelated. Trump is not a conservative in the mold of Ronald Reagan, said Brinkley, assessing his most important political influences. “He’s a Nixonian culture wars guy.”

And Vietnam, the war, its veterans and what citizens of this country thought of them or did or didn’t do for them became the crucible of those culture wars.

In the middle of the 1980s, in the wake of the career-making opening of Trump Tower, Trump co-chaired the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission and gave his time (albeit sporadically, some said) and money ($1 million) in the effort to build the city’s memorial along the East River. “I was a very strong opponent of the Vietnam War,” he told the Times at the dedication in May of 1985, “but I also recognized that the people who went to fight were great Americans. I always thought they got a bad shake in life and never got their just recognition.”

A decade later, though, on the Howard Stern Show, Trump compared that service and sacrifice with his post-divorces dating capers.

“Dating is like being in Vietnam,” he said in 1993.

The danger of dating, he said in 1997, was the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. “My own personal Vietnam,” he explained. “I feel like a great and very brave soldier.”

Two years after that, when he was talking about running for president as a Reform Party candidate, Trump for the first time was asked about Vietnam in a specifically political context.

“Did you serve in the military,” Tim Russert asked him on “Meet the Press” in October of 1999.

“I did not.”

“What reason?”

“Well, I got very lucky. We had lottery numbers, and I guess this was my biggest factor of luck in my life …”

“The Vietnam War build-up in 1965,” Chris Matthews said to Trump the following month on MSNBC. “Would you have done that?”

His blunt response in retrospect was an initial glimpse at two of the animating themes of his zero-sum foreign policy. Brawn. With a strain of isolationism. “Vietnam was a disaster,” Trump told Matthews. “It was too far away. It didn’t affect us. I guess if you do it, you have to go to win. We didn’t go to win. But I think Vietnam would have been a good place for us to stay out of.”

In 2005 and ’06, enjoying his spiking, Apprentice-amped celebrity and talking again to shock jocks instead of political pundits, Trump commented on America’s growing crisis in Iraq with additional references to Vietnam.

“Remember in Vietnam when we used to say, there used to be a certain group that would say, ‘Declare victory and leave’?” Trump told Don Imus. “Well, that sounds like one here—‘declare victory and leave,’” he said, advocating essentially for the military version of a familiar Trump tactic.

“Iraq is the biggest disaster ever,” he said to Stern.

“Disaster?” Stern said.

“It’s making Vietnam look like a good war,” Trump said.

Finally, in 2008, in what now feels like a frivolous interlude, Miss Universe, which Trump at the time co-owned with NBC, held its annual pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam. The winner was Miss Venezuela. Rounding out the top five were Miss Colombia, Miss Dominican Republic, Miss Mexico and Miss Russia. For the second straight year, during the evening gown portion of the competition, Miss USA slipped and fell. An ascendant Lady Gaga sang a song. Jerry Springer was one of the hosts. Donald Trump Jr. was one of the judges. His famous father, though, wasn’t there, later explaining to Stern that the plane flight was too long.

It wasn’t until Trump started to really run for president that the primacy of Vietnam’s role in his life began to come into fuller focus. The ways he used it were revealing. “It’s not like he’s particularly interested in Vietnam as a country,” Charlie Laderman, a historian at King’s College London and one of the authors of the 2017 book, Donald Trump: The Making of a World View, told me. “It’s something he’s able to utilize.”

First, he recalled on occasion his work on the memorial in New York. “Every time I see a vet, and especially a Vietnam vet, they say, ‘Mr. Trump, thank you for the memorial,’” he said at a rally in Iowa, for instance, six weeks into his candidacy. (That was exactly a week after he had said McCain was “not a war hero” and was considered one “because he was captured” but that he preferred people who “weren’t captured.”)

Second, and throughout his erratic but effective campaign, he cast Vietnam as the latest addition to the roster of countries taking advantage of the U.S. “Another one,” he said in a speech in Iowa. “A new one,” he said in South Carolina. “A new hot one,” he said in Connecticut.

More than anything else, though, he used the war in Vietnam and its sad, wrenching consequences to undergird the gut-level oomph of Make America Great Again.

For Trump the setting and the stakes were new. The thought certainly was not. At New York Military Academy, the stern, upstate school he attended from 8th grade on, Trump imbibed the mantra of “in it to win it,” Peter Ticktin, one of his classmates, told me. That, Ticktin said, applied to Americans and America. “It was the feeling of supremacy that this country had in the 1950s,” Trump said to graduating students in a speech at Lehigh University in 1988. “It was a feeling of supremacy. It really was. And I had—I didn’t know it well—I was very young at that point—and I didn’t know the feeling of supremacy. I’ve known that since the Vietnam War …”

Now, though, as his bid for president built, he bored down on this idea.

“So,” he said in New Hampshire, “when I was young and went to school, I had always heard we never lost, this country, we never lost a war, you know, World War I, World War II, we—we just didn’t lose wars. And since then, I mean, when you think of it, you look at Vietnam …”

“Prior to Vietnam, we never lost a war, right?” he said in Tennessee. “Vietnam was a loss. Nothing else you can call it. And then after that, we now—we don’t even think about winning.”

“Since Vietnam,” he said in Ohio, “we don’t win anymore.”

As president, in addition to attacking on Twitter Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, whom he’s dubbed “Da Nang Dick,” Trump has hosted the Vietnamese prime minister at the White House, where he credited Nguyen Xuan Phuc with having “done a spectacular job.” This will be Trump’s second visit to Vietnam, where he’s more popular than he is at home. On his first visit, in November of 2017, he met again with Phuc and also met with some American veterans. They were, he said, “special, special people,” “great, great warriors” and “tough, smart cookies.”

“Like many of that era, he has been fixated on Vietnam ever since,” Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio told me this week. “Those who didn’t serve carry guilt and resentment over the feelings of guilt. Trump isn’t the type to get over anything let alone this issue.”

And he continues to process it in the way he processes nearly everything. “In a way,” added fellow biographer Blair, “it’s as if he’s an ongoing, one-man focus group, constantly trying things out and seeing how they play in terms of his own self-interest.”

What struck Laderman the most in his research for his book was the apparent lack of importance of ideals or values in the formation of Trump’s foreign policy and overall view of the world. With respect to Vietnam specifically, according to Laderman, what seemed to trouble Trump was not that the defeat was (as many conservatives saw it) a setback in the broader Cold War struggle or (as many liberals saw it) an undermining of America’s positioning as a global promoter of human rights. “It all really does,” Laderman said, “come back to power in a very naked sense.”

washingtonpost,Trump’s bid for history in Hanoi is overwhelmed by Michael Cohen’s spectacle in Washington,"President Trump spent Wednesday here in Vietnam cozying up to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over grilled sirloin and chocolate lava cake and reaching for the legacy he wants: the great dealmaker negotiating a historic nuclear arms accord.

But halfway around the globe, an entirely different legacy for Trump was thrust to the fore by his longtime personal attorney and fixer — that of an alleged con man, liar, racist and, ultimately, criminal.

Michael Cohen’s explosive testimony to Congress was not only potentially humiliating for Trump. It also portrayed the president as an unreliable and dishonest man at the very moment he is conducting diplomacy with the world’s most erratic and untrusting dictator. And it propelled Trump’s presidency into greater legal and political peril.

On a day when two events of potentially lasting importance played out simultaneously some 8,300 miles apart, the spectacle in Washington overwhelmed the one in Hanoi.

This reality came into sharp relief as Trump sat down with Kim for a one-on-one chat before dinner here on Wednesday evening. Trump had just boasted of his warm relationship with the North Korean dictator, whom he called “a great leader,” when a reporter asked for his reaction to Cohen’s testimony. Trump did not respond and simply shook his head. But shortly thereafter, that reporter and three others were banned by the White House from covering the dinner because of what Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders called “sensitivities to the shouted questions.”

Cohen’s testimony added to the investigative morass that has consumed Trump’s presidency and served as a reminder of its continual state of turmoil. Although he sat in a hearing room addressing the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Cohen might as well have been talking directly to his former boss.

“I have fixed things,” he said, “but I am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump.”

Trump had orchestrated his first full day in Vietnam to project American power. He announced billions of dollars in Vietnamese aircraft purchases, basked in the crowds lining the highways to see him and bantered with flag-waving schoolchildren. The president was meeting with Vietnamese officials when Cohen’s prepared testimony began emerging overnight in Washington, which is 12 hours behind Hanoi.

Trump has complained that the federal investigation involving Cohen, as well as the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, has undercut his image with world leaders. And as he rested in his hotel room Wednesday afternoon ahead of his first interactions with Kim, he took to Twitter to tee off about Cohen.

“Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately),” Trump wrote. “He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked’s lawyer!”

During the lull, Trump also slammed one of his Democratic critics, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, writing, “I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud — he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!”

Trump was referring to Blumenthal’s admission during his 2010 Senate campaign that he misrepresented his military service. He was in the Marine Corps Reserve but did his service in the United States, not in Vietnam. Trump has made up claims about Blumenthal, such as saying the senator brags about his heroism in Danang.

For his part, Trump received deferments from the Vietnam draft, citing bone spurs. In his testimony, Cohen recalled that Trump asked him to manage news coverage of his deferments and once told him, “You think I’m stupid? I wasn’t going to Vietnam.”

Trump had scheduled this week’s two-day summit partially to get away from his domestic troubles, but they nevertheless haunted him here as television networks aired round-the-clock coverage of Cohen’s testimony — an outcome likely to enrage the president, observers and advisers said.

“Nothing else gets to Trump worse than being upstaged,” said Tim O’Brien, author of the biography “Trump Nation: The Art of Being The Donald.”

O’Brien predicted that Cohen’s testimony would get under the president’s skin because it highlighted so many of Trump’s insecurities and perceived weaknesses: his attempts to cover up his academic performance, his lack of service in the Vietnam War, his alleged relations with an adult-film star and the payments made to her, and allegations of racism.

“It’s an epic troll, one of the most epic trolls of Trump’s life,” O’Brien said.

White House officials had hoped Trump would not become distracted overseas by the spectacle of his former attorney and fixer testifying publicly for the first time. But the president’s mind, no matter where he is, often is on domestic issues and his political standing, current and former advisers said.

The episode threatens to weaken America’s standing abroad, according to Ben Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama.

“The real danger for U.S. credibility and national security is the extent to which the Cohen testimony makes the American president look ridiculous and compromised around the world, which carefully consumes U.S. political news,” Rhodes said. “At home, we can see these things as just another turn in the tabloid drama of the Trump presidency, but the cumulative impact abroad is a steady diminution of America’s standing.”

Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, said before Cohen’s testimony that he did not think the president would pay much attention to it. Other advisers said they were sure that he would — even as they wished he would not.

“He’s too busy for that,” Giuliani said in text messages to The Washington Post. “Cohen’s lying is not unexpected.”

Giuliani said Cohen’s prepared remarks were “pathetic,” adding, “This is a lawyer who [taped] his own client when he claimed he was being loyal. If you believe him you are a fool.”

Trump was urging his team to respond to Cohen even before he touched down in Hanoi on Tuesday night, according to one adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal White House conversations. Republican National Committee officials were instructed to repudiate Cohen’s testimony by pointing to his past lies to Congress, while Sanders attacked Cohen as a “disgraced felon” in a statement this week.

But as Cohen’s testimony continued for hours Wednesday, there was little response from the White House. Senior aides traveling in Hanoi hung out Wednesday evening at the swanky bar in their hotel, where the testimony was playing, but did not comment publicly. Instead, it fell to the RNC and members of Congress to deliver the defense the president has promulgated: that Cohen cannot be trusted on any topic because of his past lies to Congress.

Advisers have said Trump considers Cohen’s move an act of personal betrayal because he considers himself to be the main promoter of Cohen’s career. But it is difficult for Trump to discredit Cohen because of his longtime association with the lawyer and the previous instances in which Trump relied upon Cohen or defended his honor or intelligence.

Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, an informal Trump adviser, said on ABC News that “there hasn’t been one Republican yet who’s tried to defend the president on the substance. I think that’s something that should be concerning to the White House.”

This is not Trump’s first bout of domestic headaches while on the road. While in Europe last summer, for example, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted Russian agents on charges of attempting to influence the 2016 election in support of Trump.

Just before Trump went to Asia in late 2017, Mueller charged his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as well as his former deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates.

And during his inaugural foreign trip to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, Trump was largely distracted by Mueller, former aides said. The special counsel had just been appointed after Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey and then bad-mouthed him to senior Russian diplomats in the Oval Office.

This time, it is Cohen’s testimony providing the domestic sideshow to Trump’s turn on the world stage. And with the president under siege back home, he may have been comforted in Hanoi by his traveling entourage.

Spotted at the president’s hotel was Fox News host Sean Hannity, a longtime Trump friend and informal adviser. Just as at the first Trump-Kim summit last year in Singapore, Hannity is scheduled to conduct an interview with the president on Thursday following his meetings with the North Korean autocrat.

Even that does not provide a complete respite, however. One of Cohen’s few other legal clients in recent years, according to court testimony, was Sean Hannity.",2019,02,27,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/thousands-of-miles-away-from-washington-trump-takes-aim-at-cohen/2019/02/27/223ae876-3a6a-11e9-b786-d6abcbcd212a_story.html
nytimes,"Trump Is ‘Not Happy’ With Border Deal, but Doesn’t Say if He Will Sign It","WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared poised on Tuesday to end two months of scorched-earth confrontation without the money he demanded for a border wall as Republicans pressured him to accept a bipartisan spending deal rather than close the government again on Friday.

Mr. Trump pronounced himself unsatisfied with the agreement brokered by House and Senate negotiators, and he refused to publicly commit to signing it. But he all but ruled out another government shutdown and emphasized that he would find “other methods” to finance a border barrier, leading aides and allies to predict he would grudgingly go along with the deal.

“Am I happy at first glance?” the president said, speaking with reporters at the beginning of a cabinet meeting. “I just got to see it. The answer is no, I’m not. I’m not happy.”

But he said he was “moving things around” in the budget from “far less important areas” to finance a wall even without explicit congressional approval, and he expressed no desire to repeat the standoff that shuttered many federal agencies for 35 days. “I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown,” he said.",2019,02,12,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/politics/border-wall-deal.html
politico,"On ‘Hannity,’ Trump’s summits are a smashing success","Sean Hannity asks President Donald Trump a question during a news conference in Hanoi on Thursday. The Fox News host offered up a query that connected Trump to conservative idol Ronald Reagan. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo north korea nuclear summit On ‘Hannity,’ Trump’s summits are a smashing success In Hanoi or Singapore, Helsinki or Jerusalem, Fox News personalities are always on hand to make the president look good.

HANOI, Vietnam — Stymied by bumper-to-bumper traffic in Hanoi on Tuesday as the teeming Vietnamese capital absorbed the arrival of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Sean Hannity decided to get to the studio another way.

“After literally 40 minutes not moving, we’re getting nervous about getting on the air,” Hannity told his American audience, “I hopped on a scooter.” The Fox News host and close confidant of President Donald Trump broadcast images of himself, clad in the same navy blazer he was wearing on the air, zipping through Hanoi's clogged streets on the back of a motorbike. “And by the way, we were riding on the sidewalk there, in case you were interested,” he added.

Story Continued Below

Hannity is here in Hanoi ahead of an exclusive interview with the president — the first sit-down with Trump at the conclusion of his second summit with Kim on Thursday. And when talks broke down and Trump held a news conference, one of the first people he called on was Hannity, and Hannity offered up a question that connected Trump to conservative idol Ronald Reagan.

It’s not the first time Fox News’ highest-rated prime-time host has been granted this kind of special access. Hannity has chased Trump around the globe, from Singapore to Helsinki to Hanoi, for interviews with the president, offering up softball questions at pivotal moments of the Trump presidency. The result? The first snapshot of history gets filtered through a sympathetic lens.

While thousands of journalists traipse across the world to cover major presidential events, it is rare for opinion hosts to make such trips. But it has become standard practice in the Trump era, as the president has personally invited friendly figures such as Hannity to accompany him on international forays or asked his press aides to schedule the interviews for him. The president has at times sat for simultaneous interviews with mainstream reporters — in Singapore, he talked with both Hannity and ABC's George Stephanopoulos — but just as often limited his one-on-one conversations to a friendly interlocutor.

The White House declined to comment on the record.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/2965/1155968404_6008064751001_6008049712001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

The news division at Fox sent a full roster of journalists to Hanoi, including chief political anchor Bret Baier, chief national correspondent Ed Henry, anchor Bill Hemmer, chief White House correspondent John Roberts, senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot and D.C.-based correspondent Kristin Fisher. A network spokesperson confirmed that the news division reached out multiple times to the White House to request an interview in Hanoi with the president — but the White House chose Hannity.

Unlike Fox, other networks sent only their traditional teams. The three broadcast networks — NBC, CBS and ABC — sent their broadcast anchors, though NBC included Hallie Jackson, Peter Alexander, Kelly O’Donnell and Bill Neely, who also pitch in with coverage on MSNBC. CNN's big guns — Jake Tapper, Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper — stayed in the U.S., as did MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes.

But Fox News opinion personalities stand out for their boosterish approach to these foreign trips — and their glowing coverage has at times overshadowed the news division's sober reporting. When senior administration officials visited Israel to preside over the move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, for instance, Fox host Jeanine Pirro's commentary attracted headlines of its own.

Trump's affinity for Fox News, and its pro-Trump hosts in particular, extends to the interviews he grants stateside. According to CBS reporter Mark Knoller, as of Feb. 21, Trump had done 45 interviews with Fox News since taking office. Seven of those went to Hannity, more than the number of sit-downs the president has done with every other network. Second to Fox, Trump has done five interviews each with NBC and CBS.

“It is not unprecedented for the president to have a special relationship with a particularly sympathetic journalist,” said Alex S. Jones, former director of Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. “But Hannity is not a journalist. He is a propagandist.”

“I’m a talk show host and an outspoken conservative and honest about my opinions,"" Hannity said through a spokesperson. ""I have advocated for some of the same policies as the president for 30 years on radio and 23 years on Fox News.”

It’s a testament to the mutually beneficial relationship between the increasingly powerful opinion arm of the Fox News Channel and the White House itself. Since the outset of the administration, the two have operated as close allies, with network commentators trading access for glowing coverage that has reinforced the president’s favorite storylines and fought against or ignored criticism of his administration. Trump has even staffed his team with hires from Fox, creating a tight White House-Fox feedback loop with little precedent in American history.

Heading into Singapore last year, Trump faced widespread criticism for agreeing to meet with the North Korean leader without obtaining any commitments from Kim. Critics charged the president was turning a pariah into an equal partner on the world stage, while naively allowing North Korea to establish itself as a de facto nuclear power.

Hannity brushed aside those concerns, comparing the summit with Kim with the one between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, one that historians consider the beginning of the end of the Cold War.

“You know, in the lead-up to this, and this was pretty amazing,” Hannity told Trump at the close of the Singapore summit. “[Kim] had dismantled a nuclear test site, he crossed over the DMZ, three hostages were released, the missiles stopped being fired. You wouldn’t have come here if he was not willing to talk about denuclearization … all of that happened before you walked in and I don’t remember that you said ‘cargo planes of cash’ or gave anything really before the lead-up. Why do you think he’s interested in doing this after spending that time with him?”

Hannity was there, too, to provide a soft landing after the president's press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki six weeks later, an event slammed by Republicans and Democrats alike after Trump, standing beside the Russian leader, said he didn’t see “any reason” why Moscow would have interfered in the 2016 election despite the U.S. intelligence community's assessment to the contrary.

”You were very strong at the end of that press conference,” Hannity told Trump.

Many of his colleagues disagreed. “Disgusting,” said Fox host Neil Cavuto. “Almost surreal at points,” said news anchor Bret Baier. “Probably the low point of the presidency,” said Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.

Hannity expressed no such reservations about Trump’s performance — instead, he took issue with the “unhinged” media voicing displeasure.

Among the narratives Hannity and Trump have advanced in their globetrotting interviews is that of a dishonest media out to get the president.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/2701/1155968404_6008300712001_6008307013001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

“Obviously I’m a pretty strong critic of our news media in this country,” Hannity told Trump after the Singapore summit.

“The media is upset you say ‘enemy of the people.’ Aren’t you saying they’re not doing their job?” Hannity asked him in Helsinki.

Various Fox hosts have been critical of the president at times, be it Tucker Carlson blasting him for moving toward Democrats on gun control or Laura Ingraham ripping his handling of immigration. As for Hannity, he has allowed that Trump is ""not a perfect person"" and gently suggested ""maybe he shouldn’t tweet out every thought he has.""

But these critiques have generally come from the president's right — and more broadly, the line between the White House and the opinion arm of the Fox News Channel became increasingly blurry when longtime Hannity pal Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive and onetime Hannity producer, joined the White House as communications director last July. Shine remains in regular contact with his former colleagues, including Hannity, Carlson and the cast of Trump's favorite morning show, “Fox and Friends.”

Shine is among several former Fox News executives and personalities who either joined the administration or were considered for jobs. Heather Nauert, a former Fox News correspondent, became the State Department spokeswoman and recently withdrew from consideration to be ambassador to the United Nations. Pirro, a former judge in Westchester, N.Y., spoke with transition aides in late 2016 about joining the Department of Justice, and the president has raised the prospect of nominating her to the federal bench. Sebastian Gorka, a longtime commentator on various Fox News programs, briefly joined the White House but left the administration in August 2017 amid disputed circumstances.

“We certainly haven't had a television network with this kind of close relationship, but if you think about 19th-century newspapers, there were lots of newspapers that took it proudly as their mission,” said David Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism and contributor to POLITICO Magazine, “to put out the message of their party’s president.”

At times, it has been unclear whether Hannity is a part of the White House staff or a member of the press corps. When the president toured the Rio Grande Valley last month, The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker, the designated pool reporter, noted, “Sean Hannity has special access here. He huddled with Bill Shine and [Homeland Security] Secretary [Kirstjen] Nielsen and is following along on Trump’s tour, only standing with staff and federal officials as opposed to the press corps.”

The special access has been good business for Fox and its pro-Trump hosts. Hannity’s coverage from Singapore overshadowed the network's news coverage, which was led by Baier and Chris Wallace. His broadcast on the eve of the summit was the highest-rated program on all of television, beating out ""The Bachelorette” and prompting Forbes to write: “Who Won the Trump Kim Summit? Sean Hannity Did.” His exclusive interview after the Trump-Putin did almost as well, bringing in nearly 4 million viewers, a number that crushed the cable news competition.

Pirro, a New Yorker with a decadeslong relationship with the president, built a website for her 10-day sojourn to Israel, selling packages complete with tours of “hotspots” of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and various biblical sites. The cost for a “gold” package was $3,295; for platinum, the fee was $3,995. And for an extra $500, guests could “enjoy a private dinner with Judge Jeanine and invited guest Prime Minister Netanyahu.”

Her coverage was as gushing as Hannity’s. She broadcast “man-on-the-street” interviews from Jerusalem on her show, asking Israelis what they thought of the embassy move — all were in favor — and repeating, “so he’s a man of his word?” She also attended the invite-only opening ceremony of the embassy itself, along with Jewish-American luminaries including lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Republican donor Sheldon Adelson. The evening beforehand, she lauded the move as “a truly historic moment in Israel’s history” and also hailed Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the nuclear deal with Iran.

“Trump has reassured the world that his word is worth more than any previous presidents,” she said. “His word is worth more than any treaty and stronger than any U.N. resolution.” The president, Pirro added, “like King Cyrus before him, fulfilled the biblical prophecy of the gods worshipped by Jews, Christians and, yes, Muslims, that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state and that the Jewish people finally deserve a righteous, free and sovereign Israel.”

vox,"Trump’s second presidential physical exam, explained","President Donald Trump had his second full physical exam last Friday. By that evening, the 72-year-old’s personal physician — Dr. Sean Conley — released a statement saying a team of 11 doctors had examined Trump, and that Trump is in “very good health.” In an unusual move, he also predicted the future over the next two years by stating that he expects the commander-in-chief to remain healthy “for the remainder of his presidency and beyond.”

A week later, a few more details have now emerged in a final medical statement — most notably, that Trump gained four pounds, which means he’s now technically obese. But altogether, the report appears to be a nothingburger. It didn’t really reveal anything new about the president’s health.

Trump medical report out —> pic.twitter.com/moMcAS0Ksa — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) February 14, 2019

And we shouldn’t expect anything more: The presidential physical exam is best understood as political theater — a show of the president’s vigor and fitness — not an opportunity to reveal new medical information. Here’s what to know about the second exam.

What a presidential physical exam involves

Trump’s physical this year was conducted by Dr. Sean Conley, a Navy officer who took over the job from Ronny Jackson last year. It lasted four hours and took place at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington. Conley determined Trump is in “very good health overall.”

Conley’s predecessor, Jackson, had served in three administrations — that of George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump — then left the post in 2018 when the president nominated him for secretary of veterans affairs. He later withdrew his nomination after getting embroiled in a number of scandals, including allegations of excessive drinking on the job and improper prescribing of medications to White House staff. (The New York Times reports he has returned to the White House medical unit in the capacity of assistant to the president and chief White House medical adviser.)

Scandals aside, the physicals White House doctors perform look a lot like any physical a man Trump’s age would get: basic lab tests (cholesterol, hormone, and vitamin level tests), screening tests for age-related disease (such as cancer or heart disease), and the standard slew of other health assessments like checking blood pressure and the eyes, ears, and throat.

Last year, Jackson determined that Trump was in “excellent” physical and cognitive condition. That physical attracted an unusual degree of scrutiny amid questions about Trump’s mental health and fitness for office. In a first, Trump had requested a cognitive exam — apparently a response to Democratic members of Congress who had reignited the discussion about the 25th Amendment, a process that could remove a president who is unfit to govern.

The presidential physical doesn’t typically include an evaluation of mental fitness, and Conley did not report that he did another cognitive assessment this year.

What we know about Trump’s physical health and habits

As with his tax records, candidate Trump never released his medical records. So what we knew about his health, until last year’s physical results were announced, was mostly gleaned from media reports and dubious notes penned by his colorful longtime doctor, Harold Bornstein.

Last year, Jackson reported that Trump’s blood pressure was 122/74, which is in the normal range. Trump’s PSA was very low, meaning he has no prostate troubles. His total cholesterol was 223, and his LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol was 143, which is borderline high. Trump’s 20/30 vision was very good for his age. At 6-foot-3, he weighed in at 239 pounds — one pound shy of obesity, according to the body mass index.

This year, Conley reported that not much had changed. Trump is 6’3 and weighs 243 pounds, which means he’s gained a few pounds and is now technically obese. His total cholesterol is 196 (with an HDL of 58 and an LDL of 122) and is still on the high side. His blood pressure — at 118/80— is still in the normal range. There were no major changes in his health from last year, except for an increase in his statin dose, and the addition of shingles and pneumonia vaccines.

We also know Trump doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke, and he sleeps about four to five hours per night. The president takes a pretty standard range of medications for his age, including Ambien to help him sleep when he travels overseas; Crestor, a statin that lowers cholesterol; a low dose of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease; antibiotics to control rosacea; and Propecia for baldness.

Last year, Jackson had suggested Trump try to lose a few pounds and exercise more. But, as CNN reported, Trump hasn’t followed doctor’s orders. “The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,” Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary, told CNN.

The news agency also reported that Trump likely hasn’t made any use of the White House gym, and instead gets his exercise by walking between White House buildings and golfing. This failure to workout might be explained by Trump’s extraordinary beliefs about exercise. In a New Yorker story about how Trump could realistically be removed from the presidency, Evan Osnos wrote: “Other than golf, he considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy.”

Finally, we know Trump favors fast food because he thinks it’s cleaner and safer than other food. According to a new book by his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and ex-top aide David Bossie, Let Trump Be Trump, Trump has a prodigious appetite and in one sitting ate “two Big Macs, two Fillet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,” the Washington Post reported.

The long-simmering questions about Trump’s mental health

As for Trump’s mental health, he got a perfect 30/30 score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment last year. The Montreal assessment is a standard test of cognitive fitness and should rule out obvious neurological impairment.

Yet even when Trump was still just a candidate, mental health professionals were speculating about his psychology and mental health — in Atlantic cover stories, in Vanity Fair, and on Twitter. There was talk about him exhibiting the personality trait of narcissism and signs of mental disorders.

Once he was elected president and his behavior became a matter of national security, the discussion got considerably more heated.

A group of 27 mental health professionals put together a book called The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, which offered the view that “Trump’s mental state presents a clear and present danger to our nation and individual well-being.” The Yale psychiatrist who edited that book, Bandy Lee, recently told Vox she has advised Congress on the need for an emergency psychiatric evaluation because of the threat the president poses to public health.

Richard Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry and director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College, argued in the Washington Post in 2018 that we don’t even need to test Trump’s mental health because we already have ample evidence he is unfit.

“Testing wouldn’t be conclusive, shouldn’t be the basis for disqualifying someone for the presidency and wouldn’t tell us anything we don’t already know,” he wrote, adding that “the most accurate measure of a person’s fitness, whether mental or physical, is observable function in the real world — not the results of a fancy test or expert opinion. The fact is that Americans already have all the data they need to judge Trump’s fitness.”

We may not ever learn the truth about Trump’s health

As expected, Conley’s report from the presidential physical only revealed a few innocuous details about Trump.

But even if he uncovered a major health problem, we aren’t likely to hear about it. That’s because Trump is entitled to the same patient privacy rights as other Americans, and it’s up to him what gets reported to the public. Neither the president nor his doctor is under any obligation to share complete or detailed medical records.

Presidents and presidential candidates have also had a historically flimsy relationship with the truth when it comes to their health. Hiding a president’s medical history is pretty much the norm.

Jacob Appel, an assistant professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine who studies the health histories of candidates, told Vox in 2018 he’s convinced the public would not know if a president or presidential candidate is truly sick “until history renders its verdict years from now.”

If Trump did have a more involved cognitive function test, we probably wouldn’t find out the results.

“I don’t think they would say the president is depressed or has had a stroke and has memory issues, and part of the reason they wouldn’t do that is that it could imperil national security,” said Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at NYU School of Medicine.

Looking back, we now know a number of past presidents and presidential candidates who were actually much sicker in office than the public knew. FDR’s paralysis was kept from public view, as was Woodrow Wilson’s 1919 stroke, which left him incapacitated. “His wife and his senior advisers ran the country while he was indisposed for many months,” Appel said. “The public was entirely unaware.”

That’s why Appel thinks it’s unfair that many members of the media have questioned Trump’s health while implying past presidents were perfectly healthy. “The reality is many presidents have been extraordinarily unhealthy — even at death’s door.”",2019,02,08,https://www.vox.com/2019/2/8/18216849/trump-presidential-physical-exam-explained
npr,Foes Of Trump's Restrictions On Family Planning Clinics See Law On Their Side,"Foes Of Trump's Restrictions On Family Planning Clinics See Law On Their Side

Enlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images

State attorneys general and women's health advocates who are hoping to block in court new Trump administration rules for Title X, the federal family planning program, face one major obstacle: The Supreme Court upheld very similar rules in 1991.

Those rules were summarily canceled after a change in administrations. But the court is arguably more conservative than it was 28 years ago.

Still, those who oppose the Trump administration's rules say that the ground has shifted. They expect to succeed in court this time, they say — pointing to protections enacted in the 2010 Affordable Care Act and changes made by Congress in the mid-1990s in bills that fund Title X.

""I don't file a lawsuit unless I'm confident we will prevail,"" Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said at a news conference Monday, as he announced his plans to sue the Trump administration over the changes to the program. ""We've filed 17 cases against this administration,"" Ferguson said. ""We have not lost a case yet.""

The new rules for Title X, posted Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services, are aimed primarily at evicting Planned Parenthood from the program — a longtime goal of abortion opponents. Currently no Title X money can be used for abortions. But conservative groups argue that since many Planned Parenthood affiliates receiving Title X support also provide abortions, the federal family planning money could be improperly commingled with funds used for the procedure.

Planned Parenthood affiliates serve about 40 percent of the program's 4 million patients.

Specifically, Trump's rules would forbid family planning providers in almost all cases from referring pregnant patients for abortion. It also would rescind previous regulations that require providers to give women with unintended pregnancies ""nondirective"" counseling about all their options. ""Nondirective"" counseling has meant that providers can neither encourage nor deter women from any specific action. Women's health advocates, including Planned Parenthood, argue that changing that provision, as the Trump administration wants to, would hamper physicians and other providers from giving women unbiased advice, which they say is a violation of medical ethics.

The new regulations also would require any providers that also perform abortions to make those facilities physically and financially separate from their clinics that receive federal funds.

Planned Parenthood has not specifically announced that it will sue, but Dr. Leana Wen, the organization's president, was clear last week in a call with reporters that ""Planned Parenthood cannot participate in a program that would force our providers to compromise their ethics.""

And several other lawsuits are being lined up in anticipation of the rules' formal publication in the Federal Register, expected next week.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced it will sue on behalf of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, which represents publicly funded family planning providers and administrators, as well as the Cedar River Clinics in Washington state. The Center for Reproductive Rights has said it will sue on behalf of family planning providers in Maine.

Several other state officials have said that they will sue, including officials in New York, Oregon and California.

Proponents of the administration's move point to the 1991 Supreme Court case Rust v. Sullivan as proof that the rules are constitutional. In a 5-4 decision, the court said that very similar regulations issued by the Reagan administration in 1988 were an acceptable exercise of executive authority and did not violate the underlying law or the U.S. Constitution.

Although the rules were upheld, subsequent legal action meant they were in effect only for a month before again being blocked and then rescinded by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

Alliance Defending Freedom, a law firm that opposes abortion, released a statement regarding Trump's new Title X rules that said, in part: ""The Protect Life Rule, which the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld, will prevent organizations like the nation's largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood, from funding their abortion activities through the Title X program.""

Opponents of the new rules, however, insist that the situation has changed in the years since that Supreme Court decision. For one thing, argued several members of Congress in a letter to HHS earlier this month, the department may have violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act that governs the crafting of regulations.

For example, the letter said, HHS ""declined to deem the Title X rule economically significant — completely disregarding the considerable health-related costs the rule would impose — and failed to conduct a comprehensive regulatory impact analysis.""

And while the top court is more conservative than it was in 1991, ""there are two new developments,"" Washington Assistant Attorney General Jeff Sprung told reporters; ""two statutes passed by Congress, that impose new requirements.""

One of those statutes involves language added to the spending bill that funded HHS in 1995 and was renewed in subsequent years. It restates the ban on using family planning funds for abortion, but also stipulates that ""all pregnancy counseling be nondirective.""

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act added to that, with language that, among other things, bars HHS from issuing any regulation that ""interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment options between the patient and the provider"" or that ""restricts the ability of health care providers to provide full disclosure of all relevant information to patients making health care decisions.""

Leah Litman, an assistant professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, said the now more conservative Supreme Court might not necessarily accept those arguments, as well as others likely to be raised.

But there is no question, she said, that ""the underlying scope of [the Title X program] has changed"" since 1991.

washingtonpost,Have Trump’s policies ‘lifted’ nearly 5 million Americans off food stamps?,"“Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.”

— President Trump, during the State of the Union address, Feb. 5, 2019

“We’ve lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps.”

— President Trump, at a rally in Biloxi, Miss., Nov. 26, 2018

“We have 46 million people on food stamps.”

— Candidate Donald Trump, in a speech, Burlington, Iowa, Oct. 21, 2015

President Trump lauded the number of people “lifted off food stamps” amid a slew of economic statistics in his annual State of the Union address. This is nothing new — he made some variation of this point 41 times in rallies and at speeches taking office.

Meanwhile, as he campaigned for president, Trump pointed to the number of people receiving assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) as evidence of what he insisted was the poor state of the economy.

Have the president’s economic policies meant SNAP enrollment has dropped significantly? We have added variations of this claim to our database of the president’s false and misleading statements. But given his repetition and penchant for taking credit for economic successes that are not entirely his, we decided to take a closer look.

The Facts

Let’s start with the numbers. In October 2015, around 45.4 million people received SNAP benefits. At that time, Trump used this number to argue that the country was failing to recover from the recession. By the time Trump was elected in November 2016, that number had fallen to 43.2 million people; by the time he took office, another couple hundred thousand people had dropped off the rolls.

As of October 2018, 38.5 million people received SNAP benefits. That means enrollment has declined by 4.6 million people since Trump’s election, according to the most recent publicly available data. The president regularly, inaccurately points to changes in economic numbers starting at the 2016 election, discounting the last few months of President Barack Obama’s second term. In reality, 3.6 million people — not nearly 5 million people — have stopped receiving SNAP benefits since Trump took office.

It makes sense that SNAP participation would have been falling before Trump’s election and would keep falling afterward. After all, SNAP participation generally tracks with the official poverty rate, which has been falling since 2010. And generally speaking, lower unemployment means people are less reliant on SNAP benefits.

A strong labor market and economy mean it’s easier for more people to find more stable jobs and get more hours in those jobs. Even though as of fiscal 2016 65 percent of SNAP recipients were generally not part of the labor force, (children, elderly adults or non-elderly adults with disabilities), it’s possible the recipient or someone in their household could have become employed or they could be earning more.

Experts, however, caution that the falling SNAP participation rates aren’t due only to improvements in the economy. The 1996 welfare law includes a provision that prohibits people ages 18 to 49, without minor children or disabilities, from receiving more than three months of SNAP benefits in every 36-month period unless they work at least 20 hours per week, are employed or enrolled in a work plan. States can apply to waive this provision for areas with sufficiently high unemployment. (Forty-nine of 50 states have sought a waiver at some point since the law went into effect.)

In fiscal 2009, nearly every state qualified to waive work requirements. By 2016, more than 40 states either no longer qualified or decided not to reapply for work requirement waivers. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found “more than 500,000 of these adults lost SNAP in 2016 alone in areas that reinstated the three-month time limit,” although the demographic affected by work requirements represented only about 10 percent of SNAP recipients in that fiscal year.

Reports have also suggested that immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program for fear of the administration’s immigration policies.

We asked the White House for additional information but received no response.

The Pinocchio Test

The president is taking a predictable play out of his playbook: pointing to a statistic as disastrous — then claiming credit for a turnaround even though the trend line didn’t change.

SNAP participation has been declining since 2012. The administration hasn’t issued any new proposals or policies to directly elevate people off SNAP. And as states have reinstated work requirements — at times before they were required to — the decline isn’t entirely due to fewer people qualifying for benefits. Plus, advocates say the president’s immigration policies have spooked many mixed-status families away from public programs, including SNAP.

We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. The president consistently elevates the number by dating from the election, not his inauguration, and he takes credit for a trend already underway by the time he took office. On the other hand, SNAP participation has continued to decline because of an improving economy that, in some ways, can be credited to the president’s tax cut. So we will keep it at Two Pinocchios.

Two Pinocchios

pbs,Trump’s national emergency declaration unpopular among majority of Americans,"A majority of Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist.

Sixty-one percent of U.S. adults said they do not approve of the president’s national emergency, while 36 percent say they support it. Another 3 percent of respondents said, in the days following Trump’s Friday announcement in the Rose Garden, that they were unsure of how they felt.

Trump has often cited a crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, where there has been a spike in the number of people caught crossing the border illegally in recent months, many of them from Central America and seeking asylum. However, overall, immigration experts have pointed out, the number of border apprehensions year to year has dropped from their peak in 2000.

When asked whether there was currently a national emergency along the border, a majority of Americans — 58 percent — said they disagreed, based on what they have heard and read. About as many — 57 percent — said the president misused his power when he declared a national emergency to build the wall.

Thirty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they thought there was an emergency at the border, and the same number said Trump was within his presidential authority to make that declaration.

Civil liberty advocates and state attorneys general said in the days since Trump’s announcement that they plan to challenge Trump’s national emergency declaration.

Shortly after the president’s speech, the American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement saying they planned to file a lawsuit this week challenging the president’s national emergency declaration.

Late Monday night, a coalition of 16 states, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, formally filed a lawsuit against the emergency declaration, calling it unconstitutional — specifically, that it ignores separation of powers.

On Friday, days before his coalition formally filed legal action, Becerra told NewsHour correspondent Amna Nawaz that Trump’s actions are “not only reckless, but unlawful.”

Becerra said it’s important to ensure that when Americans pay tax dollars to the federal government “that they know they are going to be used for the right purposes and the purpose Congress said, not because some president says all of a sudden he’s unhappy and he wants to declare a national emergency.”

Trump anticipated that his declaration could face legal action, laying out in his remarks Friday a series of potential events that included a lawsuit destined for the Supreme Court (where he hoped “we’ll get a fair shake, and we’ll win”). When a reporter at Friday’s event raised the question of whether the move violates the Constitution, Trump said, “I expect the courts to determine that.”

Twenty-one percent of Republicans say Trump’s national emergency should be legally challenged in court. In total, 60 percent of Americans said they felt that way, including 88 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents.

In this poll, it is not clear whether respondents want the president’s declaration to have its day in court because they oppose it, or in order to cement it as precedent for greater executive authority. But critics of Trump’s declaration — both Republicans and Democrats — have raised concerns about what kind of precedent this could set for presidential powers.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he “wished he wouldn’t have done it,” USA Today reported. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a statement that “we have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution.”

Overall, the responses by people who applauded the move mirror the president’s approval ratings since he took office. According to historic polling data from Marist, Trump’s approval ratings have hovered in the mid-30s to low-40s consistently since February 2017. In January of 2019, 39 percent of U.S. adults surveyed by the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist said they approve of the job Trump is doing.

When broken down by political party, 94 percent of Democrats disapproved of the decision, along with 63 percent of people who identify as politically independent and 12 percent of Republicans.

Trump’s declaration — made after Congress allocated a much smaller amount to border barriers than he had wanted — also highlighted divisions between him and his own party.

At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters that he “didn’t need to do this,” seemingly undermining his own argument. He also asserted that it was not for political gain, suggesting he had “already done a lot of wall for the election — for 2020.” (In fact, the Trump administration has not built any additional border barriers so far.)

So what drove him in making this declaration? On this issue, it’s all about the base, said Barbara Carvalho, director for the Marist Poll.

While 54 percent of Americans said they were less likely to vote for Trump during the 2020 presidential election after he declared a national emergency, and 12 percent said his actions bore no influence on whether or not they would vote for him, 33 percent of the registered voters in this latest poll said they were more likely to vote for him.

The PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist conducted a survey Feb. 15-17 that polled 807 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 4.6 percentage points, including 709 registered voters with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.

cnn,McCabe: 'I think it's possible' Trump is a Russian asset,"""Do you still believe the President could be a Russian asset?"" asked CNN's Anderson Cooper during an interview with McCabe on ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

""I think it's possible. I think that's why we started our investigation, and I'm really anxious to see where (special counsel Robert) Mueller concludes that,"" McCabe said.

It's another bombshell comment from McCabe, which comes days after he outlined on Sunday to CBS the reasons top US officials decided to open a counterintelligence probe and obstruction of justice investigation into the President.

McCabe is promoting his new book, ""The Threat,"" which paints a stark portrait of his time at the bureau under Trump, describing in vivid detail his version of interactions with top officials at the White House and Justice Department. The book was released Tuesday and became an instant best-seller.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway responded to McCabe's comments on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" saying McCabe's comment is ""hardly dignifying with a response.""

""He's a liar and a leaker,"" Conway said.

The former acting FBI director went on the record in that ""60 Minutes"" interview confirming some previous reports about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: That he raised the idea of wiring himself to surreptitiously record interactions with the President, and mused about which Cabinet officials might support an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump from office. Rosenstein has previously said that comment was mischaracterized.

When asked whether he thought someone should wire up to record conversations with the President, McCabe said, ""Absolutely not."" He added that it was ""an incredibly invasive and potentially precedent-setting thing to do,"" and also said he didn't think it was necessary. He said it would only be necessary to capture evidence of intent, and ""we didn't need to do that in this case, we knew what the President intended.""

McCabe took over as the leader of the FBI when Trump fired James Comey in May 2017. McCabe was pilloried throughout his time leading the department and was eventually fired in 2018, just days shy of his announced retirement date. He's under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in Washington, DC, for misleading investigators in their probe of the FBI's handling of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation.

McCabe charged that the inspector general report that was used to justify his firing was the result of improper command influence, with it being clear that the President wanted him gone before his scheduled retirement date.

CNN has previously reported McCabe opened an obstruction of justice probe into Trump before Mueller's investigation began. It was an idea previously considered by the FBI but only started following former FBI Director James Comey's dismissal in May 2017. Sources previously told CNN the decision to start the investigation included the President's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

McCabe had harsh words for the President during his interview with Cooper, charging Trump with undermining the country's top law enforcement agencies for political gain.

""This President is undermining the role of law enforcement, undermining the role of our intelligence infrastructure and negatively impacting the men and women of the FBI, and across the intelligence agencies, (and their) ability to protect this country on a daily basis,"" McCabe said.

He added that there is no doubt in his mind that the President is undermining the ""effectiveness and strength"" of government institutions.

In the interview, McCabe described the events leading up to the decision to open a counterintelligence investigation into the President, saying he's not sure if there are things not yet made public. He said that, following the President's firing of Comey and his mention of Russia as part of the rationale, the FBI was ""obligated to open the case"" as there was an ""articulable basis"" to believe a ""federal crime has been committed.""

As to why he didn't speak out earlier, McCabe said he felt he had to make an argument in a thoughtful way about how the President is undermining the justice system.

McCabe wouldn't comment on whether the President's family was being looked into by the FBI. He told Cooper that it was not something he was comfortable talking about, saying it ""could go to ongoing investigative matters.""

McCabe said he did not continue to receive updates about the Russia investigation after Mueller was appointed.

The former acting FBI director later defended Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and said ""the entire country owes him a debt of gratitude"" for appointing Mueller. ""Rod did the right thing by putting the right person in charge of that investigation.""

McCabe said he didn't know if Rosenstein should have recused himself from the Russia probe.

""It was an incredible time, the simple fact that the deputy attorney general and the acting director of the FBI were trying to figure out how to navigate a situation in which we thought the President of the United States might be involved in obstruction of justice and might be doing that to cover up some sort of inappropriate relationship with the Russians,"" McCabe said.

""It was a head-spinning moment,"" he added.

As he did in his book, McCabe also had unsparing criticism for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

McCabe said his impression on many occasions was that Sessions was not reading the President's daily intelligence brief, and said it was ""somewhat confirmed to me when I heard from our own folks that the tablet devices that are used to convey the briefing materials were not being opened on a regular basis.""",2019,02,19,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/19/politics/andrew-mccabe-trump-law-enforcement/index.html
cnn,Trump tells Europe to take back ISIS fighters,"(CNN) In a series of tweets, President Donald Trump has said European countries should take back and put on trial hundreds of ISIS fighters who have been captured in Syria.

""Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing,"" the US President tweeted late Saturday night.

He warned that as ISIS is ""ready to fall,"" more than 800 prisoners could make their way to Europe.

""The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them,"" Trump tweeted.

""The US does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.""

The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........

....The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!

Trump's comments come as the area that ISIS now controls has shrunk to just half a square kilometer , a commander with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Saturday.

The SDF has launched an offensive to oust ISIS from its last enclave in Syria, in the small town of Baghouz Al-Fawqani in the country's east.

At its height, the group controlled an area the size of Great Britain and ruled over 10 million people.

The top US general in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Paul LaCamera, responded to a question by CNN's Barbara Starr on Sunday about the issue of the detainees and said, ""The numbers are not negligible. And what happens to them is, as you stated, that's the big question.""

""Now here's the real challenge: if you joined ISIS, you handed over your passport, you handed over your ID card, you handed over your birth certificate and that was destroyed and you were issued into ISIS - so the real question is, it's not just the prisoners, the detainees, it's what are we going to do with these stateless people?"" LaCamera told reporters.

LaCamera said the issue is ""not in the military's hands. This is really in diplomatic channels.""

""It's not just the detainees - it is those that have been displaced by ISIS or don't have an identity,"" LaCamera said. ""How are we going to deal with them? You know, will the Iraqis take them? And again, if you're a refugee, you can't force them back, right?""

UK 'will not hesitate' to prevent fighters' return

On Friday UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid said Britain will ""not hestitate"" to prevent the return of ISIS fighters to the UK, but those who make it back will be investigated and potentially prosecuted.

Downing Street referred CNN to Javid's Friday statement when asked about Trump's tweets.

""We have a range of tough measures to stop people who pose a serious threat from returning to the UK, including depriving them of their British citizenship or excluding them from the UK,"" Javid said.

""We closely monitor any returnees who pose a risk and new terror legislation passed this week allows us to make traveling to certain designated regions an offense. We also support communities in their efforts to prevent radicalization.""

The Home Secretary added that it was his priority to ""ensure the safety and security of the UK"" and that he won't ""let anything jeopardize this.""

Shamima Begum traveled from London to Syria with two of her classmates when she was 15 to join the caliphate. Now 19, she told The Times that she had no regrets about going to Syria but that she wanted to come home ""to have my child."" On Saturday, her family's lawyer announced Begum had given birth to her third child.

Meanwhile, the German Interior Ministry said Sunday that citizens suspected of fighting for ISIS have the right to return to Germany.

""In principle, all German citizens, including those suspected of having fought for the so-called IS, have the right to return to Germany,"" spokeswoman Susanna Hartung told CNN in a statement. She added that an individual risk assessment is made for each person.

About 1,050 people are known by Germany security authorities to have left for Syria and Iraq since 2013 ""in order to join the side of terrorist groups,"" the Interior Ministry said. One third, it added, have already returned to Germany.

""Wherever possible, the German authorities are trying to deradicalize returnees. Support services, such as deradicalization measures, but also socio-educational and psychological support, are particularly important for returning children who may be severely traumatized and for whom criminal proceedings are out of the question,"" the statement said.

The US continues to face criticism for the plan , a move that shocked allies, appalled US lawmakers and triggered resignations -- including that of Defense Secretary James Mattis.

(The White House has said Acosta did the “best” job he could on the case and has done a “great job” as Labor secretary, and that the Epstein business—which involved dozens of minors—happened “a long time ago.”) And on Friday, some not-great news befell the president’s very favorite N.F.L. owner:

Robert Kraft, a longtime friend of President Trump and owner of the New England Patriots, faces charges in a prostitution sting connected to Florida spas, police said Friday.

Kraft, 77, is facing two charges of soliciting prostitution, police in Jupiter, Florida, said during a news conference. Two instances of Kraft at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa were caught on video, they said. Kraft was one of 25 people facing charges in the incident.

“Our concern in this investigation centers around the possibility of victims of human trafficking,” said Jupiter Police Chief Daniel Kerr, adding that there was evidence of trafficking.

Kraft—whose spokesperson “categorically” denied that he “engaged in any illegal activity”—goes way back with Trump, frequently paying visits to Mar-a-Lago, which is conveniently located just 22 miles from the Orchids of Asia Day Spa. Still, you might expect President Law and Order to come down pretty hard on his buddy boy, considering he’s previously encouraged police to rough people up during arrests, questioned the need for due process, and vocally called for five teenagers to be executed before they went to trial for a crime it turned out they did not commit. Except, of course, he’s only gung-ho about prosecuting people to the fullest extent of the law when said people are immigrants, minorities, women, or some other group with whom he can’t relate. When it comes to fellow septuagenarian billionaires and/or white people who’ve pledged their loyalty to him, it’s all innocent until proven guilty, and even then it’s not clear we can trust the courts!

Trump on Friday said he was “surprised” that Robert Kraft was busted for patronizing a sleazy massage parlor in Florida—but emphasized that his billionaire buddy “has denied it.”

Other people who’ve received the Kraft treatment from Trump include Bill O’Reilly, who the president insisted was a “good person” who didn’t do “anything wrong” after the ex–Fox News host settled for $13 million with five women who’d accused him of sexual harassment. Our newest Supreme Court justice, human six-pack Brett Kavanaugh, was given a similar pass, claiming that his treatment “violate[d] every notion of fairness, decency, and due process.” As of late Friday afternoon, the president had not taken to the Internet to decry the Kraft news as a “GIANT MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE,” “A HOAX,” or a “WITCH HUNT,” though he does do his best tweeting in the early hours of the morning, so give him time.

The Kushners eye new batch of tenants to subject to their slumlord-esque ways

After being bailed out of its worst investment ever, in part by the Qatar Investment Authority, Jared Kushner’s family has reportedly acquired more than 6,000 middle-class rental apartments valued at roughly $1.25 billion, 70 percent of which Kushner Cos. plans to borrow. According to The Wall Street Journal, the acquisition is part of a plan by the company to rebuild its suburban portfolio, which will now include roughly 22,000 units with another 6,000 in the pipeline, “due to the economics of the deals and the relatively low risk of middle-class housing during a downturn.” The First-in-Laws predict they will be able to raise rents by 3 percent annually, though hopefully for the current tenants they’re no longer engaging in alleged slumlord-esque tactics that included filing false paperwork to skirt strict oversight and subjecting people in multiple buildings to “extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust, and leaking water that tenants believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.” (The company has blamed the false documents that allowed them to get around regulations on the third parties that prepared them, and said, “if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.”)

Another apartment building votes to rid itself of the stench eau Trump

If only removing him from office was as easy as removing his name from a series of condos along the West Side Highway:

On Election Day 2016, six residential buildings called Trump Place stood in a row on Manhattan’s Upper West Side—a legacy of Donald Trump’s efforts to develop that site and a sign of the Trump name’s enduring value in New York. Soon, Trump’s name will be gone from all of them.

On Friday, the last building holding on to the name announced that it would take it down, according to an e-mail obtained by The Washington Post. That e-mail, sent out by the condo board at 220 Riverside Blvd., said that it had held a vote of building owners and that owners representing 83 percent of the building had cast votes. “Of the 83 percent [that] voted, 74.7 percent voted to remove the signage, and 25.3 percent voted not to remove the signage,” the e-mail said. “Over the next several weeks, we will select a company to carry out the required work” of removing the signs, the board said.

Last year, the board of 200 Riverside Boulevard took the Trump Organization to court after the business claimed taking its name off the building “would constitute a flagrant and material breach” of its licensing agreement, with a judge ruling in the building’s favor. Around the world, residents and investors have been desperate to rid themselves of association with Agent Orange. “It’s a bloodbath, basically. It’s a financial bloodbath,” Jeffrey Rabiea, a businessman who owns three rooms at a hotel where Trump’s name was removed in March, told The Washington Post.

Report: Cohen told prosecutors about “possible irregularities” at the Trump Organization

It’s not clear what the president’s ex-fixer discussed with law enforcement, but he’s apparently hoping it’s big enough to reduce his three-year jail sentence:

Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, met last month with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, offering information about possible irregularities within the president’s family business and about a donor to the inaugural committee, according to people familiar with the matter. . . . Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organization for a decade, spoke with the prosecutors about insurance claims the company had filed over the years, said the people, who did not elaborate on the nature of the possible irregularities.

While it was not clear whether the prosecutors found Mr. Cohen’s information credible and whether they intended to pursue it, the meeting suggests that they are interested in broader aspects of the Trump Organization, beyond their investigation into the company’s role in the hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women claiming to have had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last summer to arranging those payments.

The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization, which declined to comment. Previously, Trump has accused Cohen of lying to reduce his sentence, though he‘s slightly biased in this case. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Cohen, said only that his client is “interested in cooperating with and assisting” prosecutors “in any way they believe is helpful.”

If this Jerome Powell thing doesn’t work out, Trump’s got a new Federal Reserve candidate waiting in the wings

“Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron whose lies contributed to the sudden collapse of the energy company in one of the country’s most high-profile cases of corporate fraud, was released from federal custody on Thursday after serving more than 12 years in prison, the federal authorities said.”

politico,Trump aides worry he’ll get outfoxed in North Korea talks,"The push for a second summit came almost entirely from the President Donald Trump himself, according to current and former White House officials. | Susan Walsh/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump aides worry he’ll get outfoxed in North Korea talks President Trump is excited to meet Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. Others fear he’ll give too much away.

President Donald Trump is eagerly anticipating his second summit with Kim Jong Un, touting his “really meaningful” relationship with the North Korean strongman and insisting he’s ready to give up his nuclear arsenal.

In Washington, he’s pretty much the only one who feels that way.

Story Continued Below

Many, including several of the president’s top advisers, are less excited. Some have expressed trepidation not only that the summit, scheduled to take place next week in Hanoi, may not yield big results. They worry, too, that Trump, eager to declare victory on the world stage, could make big concessions in exchange for empty promises of denuclearization.

The push for a second summit came almost entirely from the president himself, according to current and former White House officials — but Trump remains undeterred. He has gushed about the “wonderful letters” he has received from Kim, as well as the “good rapport” he has developed with the North Korean leader and the enormous media coverage the event in Vietnam's capital is likely to attract. Trump even bragged, in a phone call Tuesday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, that he is the only person who can make progress on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, according to a person briefed on the conversation, and complained about negative news coverage he has received.

Inside the administration, concern about the upcoming summit has come from predictable skeptics, including national security adviser John Bolton, a longtime opponent of diplomacy with North Korea, but also from unexpected corners. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the man charged with leading the negotiations, has expressed frustration to allies about the lack of diplomatic progress and voiced concern that his boss will get outmaneuvered, according to a source with direct knowledge of the conversations. Other top officials, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis, simply worked to keep as much distance from the negotiations as possible.

“There is not optimism in the administration,” said Ian Bremmer, founder and president of the Eurasia Group. “Pompeo is deeply skeptical that we are going to get anything of substance on denuclearization from Kim Jong Un, and Pompeo believes the North Koreans are just playing for time.”

The State Department declined to comment. A spokesman for Bolton did not reply to a request for comment.

Bolton said bluntly in December that the North Koreans had not honored even the vague pledge, made in a joint declaration that came out of last year’s Singapore summit, to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Since then, satellite images revealed that North Korea has continued to build out a number of hidden missile bases whose existence it has never acknowledged.

“They have not lived up to the commitments so far,” Bolton said at The Wall Street Journal’s annual CEO conference, seeming to distance himself from Trump’s view of the negotiations. “That’s why I think the president thinks another summit is likely to be productive.”

The North Koreans’ continuing work on the secret nuclear sites was revealed in a detailed report published by the Beyond Parallel program, run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The program’s director, Victor Cha, a former National Security Council official, said he and his colleagues packed the report with detailed images in the hopes of catching the attention of a president who doesn’t read, but responds to imagery, Cha said in an interview on Thursday.

The report did get Trump’s attention. The president blasted out a tweet about a New York Times story summarizing the report: “The story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate,” Trump said. ""We fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal. Just more Fake News. I will be the first to let you know if things go bad!”

The administration is downplaying expectations for next week’s summit. Senior U.S. officials told reporters on Thursday that despite North Korea’s pledge to denuclearize last June, the two sides have yet to reach an agreement on what, exactly, denuclearization means — and whether Kim is committed to it. The summit, according to a senior U.S. official, will focus in part on “developing a shared understanding of what denuclearization is.”

“I don’t know if North Korea has made the decision yet to denuclearize,” the official said. Trump said earlier this week that, though he is in no rush to make a deal, he believes North Korea will “ultimately” denuclearize.

Pompeo, in an interview with NBC’s ""Today"" show on Thursday, set a low bar for the upcoming meeting. “The good news is they haven’t conducted missile tests or nuclear tests in now well over a year so that’s better than the place that we found it when the Trump administration came into office, but as the president said yesterday and as the administration has said repeatedly, this is a long and difficult task,” he said.

Other officials have publicly contradicted the president’s optimistic line on Kim’s intentions.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel told a Senate panel last month that North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal. “The regime is committed to developing a long-range nuclear armed missile that would pose a direct threat to the United States,” Haspel said.

The comments bothered Trump, according to NewsMax CEO Chris Ruddy. “I’m hearing from sources around the White House that there’s just general disappointment of the president with Director Coats,” Ruddy, a close ally of the president, told CNN host Christiane Amanpour this week. The White House declined to comment on Coats’ standing within the administration, but Trump told reporters Tuesday that he “hasn't even thought about” firing him.

Since the president’s historic meeting with Kim in Singapore last June, when the two first met face-to-face, the North Koreans have shown reluctance to deal with any American official aside from the president himself. The State Department’s special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, struggled to persuade his North Korean counterparts to work directly with him until late December, according to half a dozen sources in and outside of government familiar with the negotiations. Though they have engaged over the past six weeks, their discussions have yielded little substantive progress, and Trump and Kim are slated for another one-on-one conversation in Hanoi, administration officials said Thursday.

“If the working-level people were achieving what they wanted to achieve, then I’d feel really good about this, but the North Koreans know that they can get a better deal from the president, so they’d rather talk to just him,” Cha said.

“The North Koreans basically won’t deal with anybody other than Trump. They won’t deal with Biegun, they won’t deal with Pompeo, so if there’s going to be any movement, it’s going come at that level,” said a former administration official. “The summit does have some potential to do good because it can break the logjam. But coming out of the summit, Trump is going to want to declare it a success and a victory and everybody else will be frustrated because nothing really has changed.”

Lawmakers are no more optimistic than many in the administration, and some have begun to turn the legislative gears, proposing a bill in advance of the summit that would prevent the president from striking any deal that involves a massive troop withdrawal from South Korea.

Introduced in late January by Reps. Mike Gallagher (R.-Wisc.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) the “United States and Republic of Korea Alliance Support Act” would prohibit the Pentagon from using funds to reduce troops levels in South Korea below 22,000 unless the defense secretary certifies to Congress that it can be done without harming U.S. national security.

The presence of nearly 30,000 American soldiers in South Korea has been an ongoing preoccupation for Trump, who ordered the Pentagon to produce plans for reducing troop numbers on the peninsula several weeks before his first summit with North Korea last June. His argument — that the U.S. bears too much of the economic burden for protecting South Korea — has alarmed experts and lawmakers alike, who have expressed concern about what the president might agree to without consulting his advisers, or in the face of their opposition.

It also has threatened to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, which for decades has relied on the U.S. as the ultimate guarantor of its security.

Last year in Singapore, the president impulsively agreed to halt joint military exercises with the South Koreans, a fact that White House chief of staff John Kelly was forced to convey to former Defense Secretary Mattis after the fact, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Though administration officials have said a troop withdrawal is not under consideration, experts and lawmakers remain concerned that a similar scenario could unfold.

“Two days is a very long time to be sitting there, so I’m concerned that Trump, freewheeling, will tell Kim that troops can be on the table,” said Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",2019,02,22,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/22/trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-hanoi-strategy-1179753
cnn,Trump's loyalty obsession could lead to obstruction case,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump 's craving for loyalty from his top law enforcement officials and alleged efforts to topple those whom he perceives as threats could be leading him into deep trouble -- and even put his presidency in peril.

Then, in an interview with CNN, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe -- who was instrumental in opening an obstruction inquiry against Trump -- made his strongest claim yet that he was fired hours before his scheduled retirement as a result of an internal investigation rigged against him at the instigation of the President.

The revelations appear to fit into a consistent pattern of attempts by Trump to influence investigations in which he may be implicated and a constant campaign of public and private pressure on the officials involved.

They also beg a mysterious question yet again: Why, if the President insists there was no coordination between his 2016 campaign and Russia's election meddling plot, has he taken such pains to undermine investigations into what he has branded a huge ""hoax?""

The New York Times reported that Trump called acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker late last year to ask whether it was possible that Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, who was recused from the case, could take over anyway.

Trump lashed out at the report on Wednesday, tweeting: ""The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!""

Even in his public remarks, the President has often left the impression that top law enforcement officers had a duty to protect him -- like a personal lawyer -- rather than to the neutral administration of justice and to the Constitution.

Fired FBI Director James Comey said Trump tried to establish a mob-like relationship of patronage with him. Trump also repeatedly berated his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his failure to rein in the Russia probe.

Trump has mounted relentless, almost daily attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry and other investigations targeting his administration.

In the worst-case scenario, his incessant private, public and political efforts to influence the investigations could add up to obstruction of justice in plain sight -- and even form part of any future articles of impeachment.

Asked by CNN's Brooke Baldwin whether Trump's request to Whitaker amounted to obstruction, Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor, answered: ""What else could it be?""

""What other reason could the President have for calling Matt Whitaker right as the Cohen investigation was growing and starting to threaten him ... and asking Whitaker, 'Can we get my guy?'"" he said.

Paul Rosenzweig, a senior counsel to the Whitewater investigation, told Baldwin that if confirmed, the reporting about Trump could amount to a possible abuse of power.

""It's really hard to come up with an innocent explanation for asking somebody to unrecuse from a recusal that seems wholly appropriate,"" he said. ""It is a little early to say for sure what the facts are since Mr. Whitaker has sort of denied this -- but if the facts prove out as it is, this is potentially impeachable.""

There is no evidence that Whitaker asked Berman, who was appointed by the President's former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to take over the inquiry, a decision that led Trump to sour on Whitaker.

It is not known what Whitaker might have told the President in private conversations after he was read into the Mueller investigation. He insisted in a hearing before a House committee this month that he had not ""interfered with the special counsel's investigation in any way.""

'No obstruction'

JUST WATCHED Rep.: NYT report would constitute obstruction if true Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rep.: NYT report would constitute obstruction if true 01:23

Trump's lawyers have argued that his firing of Comey and attempts to intervene in personnel decisions in the Justice Department are consistent with his titular authority as the nation's top law enforcement official.

In a confidential letter sent to Mueller last year, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow and his then-colleague John Dowd argued that ""no President has ever faced charges of obstruction merely for exercising his constitutional authority.""

They said that a President can ""order the termination"" of a Justice Department or FBI investigation ""at any time and for any reason.""

But many legal experts believe that should Mueller establish corrupt intent, the normal standard for an obstruction charge in a criminal case, it could be conduct that could be taken up in the political context of an impeachment case.

Trump's assertion in an NBC News interview that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation could be evidence for such a finding in any final report that the special counsel decides to file.

There is historical precedent for a presidency running into existential peril after an attempt to interfere in the investigative process.

The Articles of Impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon accused the disgraced former president of ""interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ... and congressional committees.""

The New York Times reported that Whitaker knew that he could not ask Berman to do what Trump asked and that the President soured on his interim appointee when he could not make the President's legal problems go away.

The Cohen case has turned out to be especially troublesome for Trump because it opened a path for prosecutors into his private and business affairs. In a guilty plea, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said Trump ordered him to arrange payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with him -- effectively making the President an unindicted co-conspirator in a violation of campaign finance law.

Silent circle of assent

JUST WATCHED McCabe to CBS: DOJ held meetings about removing Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McCabe to CBS: DOJ held meetings about removing Trump 02:24

McCabe told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night while promoting his new book that Trump posed a threat to the FBI and the nation and said it was ""possible"" that the President was a Russian asset.

He renewed his charge that he was fired because he had done his duty in initiating an inquiry into Trump's behavior.

The White House argues that McCabe has no credibility because he is under criminal investigation for allegedly misleading investigators in their probe of the FBI's handling of the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

But he suggested that an independent departmental report used as justification for his dismissal was improperly influenced by Trump.

""The President very publicly demanded a result and the office of the Inspector General delivered that result ... the President desired that I be gone before I could be eligible to retire.""

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" that McCabe was ""a liar, and a leaker.""

McCabe also revealed Tuesday that he and other senior officials had briefed the ""Gang of Eight"" group of bipartisan leaders of the House and the Senate on the reasons for opening an investigation into Trump.

He said there was no pushback from the leaders.

""There was a clear sense in the room that people were resigned to the fact that we had taken a necessary step. That was my impression,"" McCabe said on ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

Trump's alleged propensity to lean on his top law enforcement aides first emerged in stunning public testimony, contemporaneous memos and autobiographical writings written by Comey.

Trump told the then FBI director early in his presidency, according to one leaked memo, that ""he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.""

In his book ""A Higher Loyalty,"" Comey wrote that the President's retinue reminded him of the ""silent circle of assent"" around Mafia kingpins he had prosecuted.

""The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth,"" Comey wrote.

Trump clearly expected that the kind of protection he did not get from Comey would come from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and never forgave him from recusing himself from oversight of Mueller's Russia investigation.

""The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself,"" Trump tweeted on June 5 last year, four months before the attorney general eventually resigned.

""I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!"" Trump added.

The President also several times demanded to know why Sessions had not prosecuted the ""corruption"" of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton -- in a chilling call for a politically motivated investigation against a political opponent.

The President hinted at his belief that the attorney general should serve as a kind of personal legal bodyguard when he voiced his opinion of former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder.

""I will say this: Holder protected President Obama. Totally protected him,"" Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in December 2017.

Preet Bharara, a former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was fired by Trump but only after the President called him in what the now CNN commentator sees as an attempt to cultivate a relationship.

""He's a kind of a person who doesn't understand that rules have to operate in a particular way and regular order needs to be followed whether it is recusal or arms length distance between a United States attorney or investigator and the President of the United States,"" Bharara told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead"" on Tuesday.",2019,02,20,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/politics/donald-trump-russia-matt-whitaker-robert-mueller/index.html
gallup,Trump Job Approval 50% or Higher in 17 States in 2018,"Story Highlights Job approval was below 40% in 16 states, 50% or higher in 17 states

Highest approval rating in West Virginia (62%), Wyoming (61%)

Lowest job approval in Hawaii (26%), Vermont (28%)

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Donald Trump's job approval rating varied widely across the U.S. states in 2018, with 17 states giving him ratings of 50% or higher, and 16 states giving him ratings below 40%. The states most approving of Trump were generally in the South and Mountain West areas of the country, while he fared most poorly in New England and on the West Coast.

In 2017, Trump had approval of 50% or higher in 12 states -- five fewer than in 2018 -- and approval below 40% in 17 states -- one more than in 2018. Those shifts reflect the modest improvement this past year in his approval ratings nationally, from 38% in 2017 to 40% in 2018.

The five states that moved to 50% or higher job approval last year were Missouri, Kansas, South Carolina, Mississippi and Utah.

Results are based on combined data from the 2018 Gallup tracking poll, encompassing interviews with more than 73,000 U.S. adults, including 500 or more in 38 states and 1,000 or more in 27 states. Each state sample has been weighted to match the demographic characteristics of that state's population to ensure it is representative of the state's residents. Full data for all 50 states are shown at the end of the article.

Although much can change between now and Election Day 2020, a job approval rating of 50% or higher would presumably put Trump in good position to win a state in the presidential election. The 17 states with 50%+ approval ratings account for a combined total of 102 electoral votes. In contrast, the states in which Trump has an approval rating below 40% account for 201 electoral votes.

In order to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, Trump would have to win all but one or two of the states in which his 2018 approval rating was between 41% and 49%. Some of the more challenging states to win from among this group, based on that approval rating, would be Texas (41%); Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (all at 42%); and Arizona and Florida (43%). Trump won all of those states in 2016, and thus it is certainly possible that he can do so again. But he clearly has a lot of ground to make up in those states to get close enough to 50% that he can finish with more electoral votes nationwide than the Democratic candidate.

Trump's Ratings Best in West Virginia, Wyoming

West Virginia (62%) and Wyoming (61%) residents were most approving of Trump's performance in 2018 and were the only two states with ratings above 60%. South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Mississippi and Alabama had the next-highest approval ratings for Trump, with Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas constituting the remainder of the top 10. All but Mississippi ranked among the top 10 states in 2017.

Highest Job Approval Ratings for President Trump, by State, 2018 Approve % West Virginia 62 Wyoming 61 South Dakota 58 North Dakota 58 Alaska 56 Mississippi 56 Alabama 55 Tennessee 54 Kentucky 53 Arkansas 53 Based on annual aggregate of Gallup tracking data Gallup

Trump's job approval ratings were lowest in Hawaii (26%) and Vermont (28%), with California and Massachusetts (each at 29%) also below 30%. The remainder of the bottom 10 includes Maryland, New York, Illinois, New Jersey and New Hampshire, with three states (Rhode Island, Connecticut and Washington) tied for 10th lowest.

Lowest Job Approval Ratings for President Trump, by State, 2018 Approve % Hawaii 26 Vermont 28 Massachusetts 29 California 29 Maryland 31 New York 32 Illinois 35 New Jersey 35 New Hampshire 35 Rhode Island 36 Washington 36 Connecticut 36 Based on annual aggregate of Gallup tracking data Gallup

The rank-order of Trump job approval in 2018 aligns with his performance in the 2016 presidential election. The states ranked first (West Virginia) through 30th (Texas) are the 30 states Trump won in 2016, while Trump lost every state ranked between 31st (a four-way tie between Oregon, Virginia, Nevada and Delaware) and 50th (Hawaii). Thus, it is unlikely Trump will win any states where his approval rating was not among the top 30 states in 2018.

Implications

Now that several Democratic politicians have announced their candidacies for the 2020 presidential election, the campaign gearing up. Trump's job approval ratings by state give a baseline estimate of how his re-election prospects stand from an Electoral College perspective. While his ratings in 17 states are high enough to suggest he has a good chance of winning those states in the presidential election next year, they tend to be smaller states and account for barely a third of the electoral votes he would need to win the presidency. A second Trump term will be won or lost in the larger states that he won in 2016 but had approval ratings in the low 40s in 2018. He cannot lose more than one or two of those states and still win the election, particularly because it appears unlikely that he would prevail in any state he did not win in 2016.

Increasing his approval rating by close to 10 percentage points in those key states seems like an uphill battle at this point, but several factors could make it possible. Recent polling suggests Trump's current job approval rating is already improved compared with where it was for much of 2018. If he can sustain those higher levels, presumably his approval ratings would be showing similar increases in most, if not all, states.

Second, differences in turnout by party could increase Trump's odds of winning in those states. For example, though Texas as a whole is relatively competitive in terms of party identification, Republicans continue to dominate in statewide elections there, perhaps because of lower participation among Hispanics. To the extent Republican voters in the key states participate at higher rates than Democratic voters, a Trump job approval rating in the mid- to high 40s may be enough to allow him to win those states.

Last, there are several examples when presidents who had nationwide approval ratings in the 40% range in the year before the election won a second term, including Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. All managed to get to 50% approval by the time of the presidential election.
