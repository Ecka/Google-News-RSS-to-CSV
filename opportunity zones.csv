goerie,Smart-city technology eyed for Erie's Opportunity Zones,"Security cameras, free public Wi-Fi, LED lighting could come to local neighborhoods targeted for reinvestment.

Additional security cameras, LED lighting and free public Wi-Fi were introduced to downtown Erie in 2018 as part of a pilot program for what’s known as smart-city technology.

Mayor Joe Schember's administration and other local officials want to bring the same technology to local neighborhoods targeted for reinvestment under the federal Opportunity Zone program.

Schember, in an interview last week, said his administration — working with the Erie Innovation District and others — is working to bring ""secure smart city"" equipment and technology over the next 12 months to the eight Opportunity Zones in the Erie region that have been designated by Gov. Tom Wolf’s office and certified by the U.S. Treasury Department.

According to Schember, that would include security cameras that could read license plates and have facial-recognition capabilities; energy-efficient LED street lights; and free Wi-Fi in public spaces throughout the Opportunity Zone tracts. The intent is to make those areas safer and more attractive for investment.

""It's kind of an aggressive goal. ... But let's get these areas done and within the next three years, I'd like to see that technology throughout the entire city,"" Schember said.

The city areas approved for the Opportunity Zone program are Erie’s bayfront; the former GAF Materials Corp. site on the city’s west bayfront; the area near Dobbins Landing that is planned for Scott Enterprises’ $150 million Harbor Place development; the Erie Innovation District along State Street; and the neighborhoods near UPMC Hamot and Erie Insurance.

The other tracts are the former International Paper site and the SB3 Industrial Park, both located on East Lake Road; Savocchio Business Park near East 16th Street and Downing Avenue, which would be renamed the Joyce A. Savocchio Opportunity Park as part of the city’s plan; and areas of the city adjacent to the GE Transportation facility in Lawrence Park.

Local officials are still working on funding, Schember said.

However, city officials believe the city can save $400,000 to $500,000, each year, on electrical costs by widespread implementation of LED lighting, including in the Opportunity Zones, Schember said.

The city spends about $1.2 million annually for electricity and utility pole maintenance, Schember said.

""We can then use that (savings) to help fund the other components of this,"" Schember said.

The Opportunity Zone program was created as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in December 2017 as a way to jump-start economic investment in low-income, urban and rural communities.

That program aims to encourage private investment in low-income census tracts by providing tax incentives to investors — money from capital gains can be invested with major tax advantages. City officials estimate that the region's Opportunity Zones could attract up to $600 million worth of investment.

Karl Sanchack, the Innovation District’s CEO, said moving smart city technology into the Opportunity Zones is a logical next step for Erie's smart city efforts. Smart cities are urban areas that use different forms of electronic data collection, including sensors, to supply information that is then used to efficiently manage assets and resources.

The downtown smart city pilot project was announced in April 2018 and focused on downtown and Perry Square. New LED lighting, video surveillance cameras, and free Wi-Fi were installed in an area encompassing State Street, between Sixth and 12th streets.

Quantela Inc., a global data analytics company that has worked on similar projects worldwide, helped implement the project, which was paid for by $300,000 in Erie Innovation District funds.

“From an Innovation District standpoint, I take my cues from the city and the Mayor’s Office,” Sanchack said. “We are going to start by trying to deploy the things we did (downtown) in the Opportunity Zones in 2019, and into 2020.""

Sanchack said cameras will help “provide a general sense of flow for traffic,” and they will contribute to safety and security. They can also help identify “specific license plates of interest” for Erie police in high-crime areas, he said.

LED lighting can help improve safety and save the city money, he said. And free Wi-Fi in public parks and similar spaces in Opportunity Zone areas benefit the people living and working in those areas and make the zones more enticing to potential developers.

“When you put this kind of investment into those areas, you’re well aligned for the other investment that will follow,” Sanchack said. “As we improve digital infrastructure, and as others improve the urban land use in those areas, each of those things complements the other. And you’re getting more value for the money that’s invested.”

Brett Wiler, director of capital formation for the Flagship Opportunity Zone Development Corp., agreed with Sanchack.

Wiler left city government recently to focus on federal Opportunity Zone projects full time as part of a new corporation launched by the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership.

""Strong technology infrastructure is going to be attractive to an investor, and those improvements will ultimately improve the quality of life in those areas as well,"" Wiler said.

Gary Horton, president of the Urban Erie Community Development Corp. at 2046 E. 19th St., said enhancing technology in the Opportunity Zones is crucial for underserved neighborhoods like the ones near the Savocchio business park. Horton's nonprofit recently purchased the park, which is in an Opportunity Zone on the city's east side.

Initial redevelopment plans call for a multi-use health and wellness facility, community solar farm, urban agricultural system and small business incubator.

""We have guest Wi-Fi at the UECDC and we have people all the time sitting in our parking lot or outside our building, trying to access it because they don't have it at home,"" Horton said. ""For kids, and for people in our general neighborhood, that's a big thing. We support wholeheartedly this kind of technology to enhance the safety and the quality of life.""

aikenstandard,"City of Aiken seeking opportunity zone expert to spur investments, development","The city of Aiken is interested in contracting a firm — or firms — to advise the city on the opportunity zone program and how it can be leveraged for further economic development.

A request for proposals, detailing the counsel search, was posted to the city's website Thursday. Responses are due March 20.

The adviser is expected to find and assess potential investments for the city's opportunity zone; identify and foster relationships with prospective investors; and campaign to raise awareness of the opportunity zone program, among other things.

""The city seeks to maximize the economic potential of the new opportunity zones program,"" the 11-page RFP reads.

The RFP details qualifications sought, as well: ""pre-existing knowledge and detailed, technical understanding"" of the opportunity zone program as well as ""demonstrated experience"" working with private parties and government, for example.

Vice president, Sen. Tim Scott highlight opportunity zones during Columbia visit ""Opportunity zones, for those of you not fully aware, are areas of the country that for too long have been left behind.""

Opportunity zones — officially designated tracts of land — offer tax incentives to investors. The opportunity zone program came with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act near the end of 2017; U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, pioneered the move.

Aiken is home to one opportunity zone. There are two in the North Augusta area.

Aiken's opportunity zone is generally located on the Northside, bounded to the north by Rutland Drive and bounded to the south by Vaucluse Road and Colleton Avenue S.E. The old Aiken County hospital property — now targeted for some major redevelopment — is included in it, as is Hahn Village.

Scott and Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 21 toured an opportunity zone in Columbia. In speeches afterward, Scott described the program as an ""olive branch,"" and Pence hailed it as an economic equalizer.

The Aiken opportunity zone is home to more than 6,000 people.

barrons,Private Sector Looks to Measure Impact of Opportunity Zones,"Investors who want to make a positive social or environmental impact while earning a financial return would seem naturally drawn to investing in “opportunity zones,” low-income areas throughout the U.S. designated by governors in each state as in need of economic development.

But the regulatory language outlining practices for investing in these 8,700 zones offers no assurance to investors or community members that funds investing in these economically distressed areas—known as Qualified Opportunity Zone, or QOZ, funds—will have that kind of positive impact.

Philanthropists, wealth managers, and nonprofits are stepping into the void. Earlier this month, the U.S. Impact Investing Alliance and the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation at Georgetown University, announced a voluntary reporting framework that offers best practices for fund managers and investors. It was written with input from more than 30 contributors, including academics, foundations, investors, asset managers, and community stakeholders.



Opportunity zones are “a once in a generation opportunity to drive very needed capital to America's distressed communities,” says Fran Seegull, executive director of the alliance. But, Seegull says, “this policy will only meet its objective of achieving positive economic and social outcomes for these communities if we understand where funds are flowing and how that capital is helping drive positive social and economic change.”

QOZ funds grew out of language in the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. They are getting broad attention because of the considerable tax advantages they offer to individuals and businesses by allowing capital gains to be deferred into these vehicles. The tax advantages grow the longer the investment is held.

The problem for investors who want to grab these tax savings is that many of the guidelines for investing in QOZ funds are unclear. Specifically, the current regulations make it difficult to invest in businesses located in designated areas, and they make it difficult to invest in multi-asset funds.

These and other issues have been brought to the attention of the U.S. Treasury, through public comment letters and at an Internal Revenue Service hearing earlier this month. According to Seegull, Treasury is expected to issue further clarity on a range of issues via a series of regulations over this year and next.

It’s unknown, however, whether the IRS will address some of the issues raised by impact investors to ensure that the guidelines meet what Seegull says was the intent of the legislation. Specifically, the alliance, at minimum, wants QOZ funds to be required to provide basic QOZ fund and market-level data, including the amount of assets raised and where they’re being deployed.

“We believe the addition of some of these annual reporting metrics will give us a better feel for where money is flowing, it will aid in capital formation for fund managers, and it will also aid communities to understand where capital is flowing and what the intentions are,” Seegull says. “Over time, we believe that this kind of data is necessary to ascertain the effectiveness of the policy itself.”

The alliance argues that Treasury has the authority to collect transaction data. But Steve Glickman, the former CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, which helped develop the QOZ concept, says the core reporting requirements that were in the original proposed legislation were stripped out of the 2017 tax act, because the U.S. Senate took out all language that wasn’t related to budgetary issues.

“It was deemed those reporting requirements were not relevant—it wasn’t a political or substantive decision, it was a procedural decision,” Glickman says.

Adding reporting requirements would require additional legislation at the federal level, or legislation by states or localities, collectively or individually, he adds. Or, the philanthropic and private sector can step in to create the additional infrastructure, as many are working to do.

Glickman cautions, however, that the purpose of the Opportunity Zone legislation was to stimulate market-based activity in low-income, high-poverty areas, and to sustain that activity with incentives for long-term investment in communities that otherwise would have been ignored.

It wasn’t meant to only fit the parameters of impact investing, “a segment of the marketplace, and a potentially really important one,” Glickman says. “But almost, for sure, a minority of the type of investment being done.”

Still, a robust effort on the part of philanthropists and other private-sector actors—such as the voluntary reporting framework—is an effort to ensure that the communities served by QOZ funds achieve real results.

“It will be incumbent on private sector players, whether developers, the private equity investors, and ourselves as allocators and investors, to ensure that we’re delivering both returns that make sense for investors—that’s partly why they are allocating capital here—and that the investments that are made actually take the needs of communities and local stakeholders into account,” says Andrew Lee, head of sustainable and impact investing, Americas, in the chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management. “That is the challenge, to make sure everybody is focused on that.”

The Rockefeller and Kresge Foundations are seeking to support fund managers who can demonstrate their intent to “ensure positive outcomes” in the designated communities with grant capital. The Beeck Center, meanwhile, is creating an Opportunity Zone council of potential investors committed to adopting the voluntary reporting framework.

“We’re really hoping this impact framework helps people get very clear on intentionality, helps measure the social outcomes that are desired and can be used as a real tool to drive capital in meaningful ways into these areas,” says Jennifer Collins, fellow in residence at the Beeck Center.",0,0,0,https://www.barrons.com/articles/private-sector-looks-to-measure-impact-of-opportunity-zones-01551278200
mlive,Trump’s ‘opportunity zones’ could spur development in Washtenaw County,"ANN ARBOR, MI - A new incentive in President Donald J. Trump’s tax overhaul could bring development to economically distressed areas of Washtenaw County.

However, no one has taken advantage of the incentive program locally yet, and officials are still learning about regulations.

The new “opportunity zones” incentive -- created by Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017 -- offers tax breaks to people and corporations that invest their capital gains in real estate and business development in designated areas.

Now that each state has selected its designated opportunity zones, Ann Arbor SPARK and other economic organizations are working to connect investors with development opportunities. The investments need to be made by 2021 to take advantage of the tax breaks, said Phil Santer, senior vice president and chief of staff at Ann Arbor SPARK.

Washtenaw County has 11 opportunity zones, which generally have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent. Local opportunity zones are located primarily in Ypsilanti and the eastern part of Ypsilanti Township, plus some census tracts in Pittsfield Township and Chelsea.

The Washtenaw County census tracts highlighted in green are opportunity zones.

Ann Arbor SPARK has highlighted the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Township and Research Park Drive in Pittsfield Township as prime places for development in the opportunity zones.

“We were trying to support development mostly on the east side of Washtenaw County,"" Santer said.

See interactive map with Ann Arbor SPARK’s recommendations for opportunity zone investments

Anyone interested in investing their capital gains in an opportunity zone can start an opportunity fund, which requires filing a form with the IRS.

Investors can defer paying taxes on their capital gains through 2026 when they invest in an opportunity fund, and they get varying tax breaks depending on how long they leave their money in the opportunity fund. After 10 years, gains from the opportunity zone investment become tax-exempt.

The opportunity funds are available to developers interested in working in the opportunity zones.

“It’s a win-win,” Santer said. “The community needs the investment, and the investor needs a way to extinguish their tax liability.”

Ann Arbor SPARK is planning to work with economic groups in Detroit to compile a list of available opportunity funds and development opportunities across southeast Michigan, Santer said.

Currently, no opportunity funds have been established for Washtenaw County. There are some opportunity funds available for Michigan, according to a directory compiled by the National Council of State Housing Agencies.

It took some time for states to designate their opportunity zones and for the U.S. Department of Treasury to finalize regulations for the tax incentive program, Santer said, and now he’s hoping to raise awareness among potential investors.

“It’s going to take some time for people to understand what the program is, how they can leverage it to their own benefit and then how we can leverage it the community’s benefit,” he said.

City of Ypsilanti Director of Economic Development Joe Meyers said he’s still learning about the opportunity zone program.

Ypsilanti recently adopted a community benefits ordinance that requires developers to make certain community investments in exchange for tax breaks. Meyers said he’s not sure yet whether the opportunity zone tax incentives will trigger Ypsilanti’s community benefits procedures, and he has upcoming training sessions on the topic.",2019,03,03,https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2019/03/trumps-opportunity-zones-could-spur-development-in-washtenaw-county.html
therealdeal,Opportunity Zones,"The burgeoning Opportunity Zone program could be one of the best development initiatives the country has ever seen, but investors and developers still shouldn’t expect it to turn every deal into a winner, top real estate executives said Wednesday morning.

“While the Opportunity Zone program certainly offers benefits that should over time reduce the cost of capital and therefore make some marginal projects that weren’t feasible, feasible, it’s not going to take projects that were absolutely infeasible and turn them into projects that are,” said Seth Pinsky, executive vice president at RXR Realty. “You still need to have an underlying project that makes sense.”

Pinsky spoke on an Opportunity Zone panel Wednesday morning with JLL’s investment sales chair Bob Knakal, Fundrise CEO Ben Miller, Heritage Equity Partners president Toby Moskovits and Meridian Capital Group managing director Steven Adler at an event thrown by The Real Deal and Berdon LLP. The panelists were very optimistic about the program overall.

The Opportunity Zone program, included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allows investors to defer taxes on income from capital gains until 2026 provided that 90 percent of their investment is in areas designated as low-income communities. The program has already proven to be extremely popular with the real estate community even as developers and investors still wait on key information about it.

Knakal described the initiative as “brilliantly conceived” with the potential to “create the best community development program the nation has ever seen.” However, he cautioned that it would only work if the people buying properties in Opportunity Zones were making a profit, something that was proving to be a challenge based on how much owners of properties in Opportunity Zones think their land’s value has increased.

He summed up the situation by inverting a famous quote from the 1987 film “Wall Street.”

“Greed, for lack of a better word, is bad,” Knakal said.

The program, Pinsky said developers looking to make Opportunity Zone deals at reasonable prices should look to secondary and tertiary markets where transactions have not already been occurring. In areas that were already seeing a good amount of activity before they were designated as Opportunity Zones, it will be much harder to find a good deal.

RXR and Heritage have both announced plans to launch Opportunity Zone funds of their own: a $500 million one for RXR and a $100 million fund for Heritage.

Both firms said they have been seeing interest from investors looking to put their money in economically challenged areas. Moskovits said investors saw it as a way to both get helpful tax benefits and make a positive impact.

“I’m getting a lot of calls from friends of mine in the private wealth industry who are advising on impact investing and getting calls from their clients asking about how to move money into these neighborhoods where they’re getting what we call the double bottom line, or doing well by doing good,” she said.

Opportunity Zones were designated based on census tracts, some of which are in areas where a large amount of development activity was already taking place. In New York City alone, this includes places like the Far West Side and the Lower East Side.

Pinsky said it is important to have capital flow into census tracts that have not already seen a lot of development to make sure the Opportunity Zone program is a political success.

“If, at the end of this program, all that’s happened is that more money has gone into the areas that were already getting capital, then the program will have proven to be a missed opportunity,” he said.",2019,02,27,https://therealdeal.com/2019/02/27/opportunity-zone-program-has-loads-of-potential-but-is-not-a-cure-all-panel/
forbes,Opportunity Zones - Look Great For Everybody Except Investors,"I finally got around to getting excited about opportunity zones (OZ). My excitement subsided as I looked into the matter, but it still remains at a subdued level. The OZ concept regardless of whatever else it might be is an illustration of Reilly's Third Law of Tax Practice -

(Note it is the third law of tax practice not planning.) Reilly's Third Law of Tax Planning is -

Any clever idea that pops into your head probably has (or will have) a corresponding rule that makes it not work.

I quickly saw that law at work as I started scheming about opportunity zones and actually reading the statute popped most of the bubbles in my head.

There is a lot out about OZ, so what I am going to give you is my assessment - the boiled down version I have to give to a client or a more practical CPA. I will be glossing over the technical details. Don't use this post to start your own OZ fund or evaluate one or prepare a return. What you will get here is my hit on whether you should be interested. Think of it as the Five Minute University explanation of OZ.

For Investors

Forget about it. It really doesn't make much sense at all. If you find a good investment that happens to be OZ qualified, you might want to think about the election, but that's pretty much it.

The OZ benefit to investors has unique attributes that make it seem attractive. Every capital gains deferral provision I can think of is measured based on proceeds. 1031 is probably the most well known. If you sell a property for a million dollars and have a hundred thousand dollar gain, you have to invest the whole million in your 1031 target to exclude the whole gain. If you invest less than $900,000 you get no gain deferral. Same sort of deal for corporate reorganizations. With an OZ election, you just need to reinvest the gain.

The other limitation common to capital gain deferrals is that it can't be just anything that you sold just because you felt like selling. No such limitation with the OZ election. As long as it is a capital gain - long or short - you can elect to reinvest in an OZ fund.

On the other hand, the benefit is pretty meager - much too meager to get someone who reflects on it to shift to a qualifying investment if it is not a type of investment that they would normally make. A CPA I consult for, who is even more of a cynical bastard than I, summed it up this way.

OK. A client inquired about it I figured it was the same old invest in bad areas and bad people get a deduction or credit and lose your high-risk money.

I really abhor the ""bad people"" crack, but there is something to it. He was one of my earliest mentors and we worked on low-income housing deals in the early eighties, which despite all the pieties about sound investments worked on the strength of their tax benefits alone.

The benefit is that instead of recognizing your capital gain in 2019, you recognize it in 2026. And if you hold the investment long enough you can get as much as a 15% reduction in the gain. But that's not all. If you hold on for ten years, you don't recognize gain on the OZ investment itself.

A Simple Example

Let's go with a 20% capital gains rate to make the math easy (Forget about NII and state tax and maybe it is a short gain). You sold something and had a $100,000 gain. Put aside $20,000 and you have $80,000 that you can do anything you want with.

Or you can take the whole $100,000 and put it into an OZ fund and make the election. Since you are a prudent person you need to find some money elsewhere so that you have $17,000 to pay out in 2027. Say $14,000. But remember, the tax will be based on capital gains rates in 2026, but capital gains rates never go up - well almost never.

Putting aside the possibility of a rate increase, but prudently reserving for the future tax it is really $94,000 that you could do anything you want with, that will buy you your $100,000 OZ investment. And at the point you make that deal how much is that OZ interest worth? If it is less than $94,000, consider Reilly's Second Law of Tax Planning - Sometimes it's better to just pay the taxes.

On The Other Hand

I interviewed Mike Novogradac, who, no kidding, is the CPA I most admire in the whole world. (I'll explain that in some other post. I think I did the lower tier audit on a deal where his firm had the upper tier, but that was a million years ago and has nothing to do with my admiration for him). Mike's eponymous firm ranks somewhere in the middle among the top fifty, depending on whom you ask.

Mike is much more upbeat about OZ. This may be related to the fact that he has built his firm around complex tax matters that involve a great deal of money. Novogradac is probably best known for its work on the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC).

His minions ran numbers on an OZ investment that went the full ten years, qualifying it for all the goodies. The benefits converted an after-tax return of 6% to 9%. Bailing out after you qualify for the 15% reduction converts 6% after tax to 7.5%. I didn't try to check those numbers, but they seem reasonable.

It is possible that by investing in an OZ you are buying low and that you have more upside to earn a strong pre-tax return, but the tax incentive is really not strong enough to shift my comfort zone.

For Property Owners

Now, this is where it gets exciting. Nobody listens to me so the OZ funds will be raising a lot of money. They already have. Here is a directory of funds.

It is up to the funds to be invested in qualified OZ properties. I'm not going to get into those rules, which are complicated and in need of even more regulatory guidance.

The funds can't just buy businesses in OZs. They need to be creating something new. So if you have a great commercial property in an OZ, it might not be that exciting. If on the other hand, you have vacant land or something that needs substantial rehab, OZ designation has quite likely enhanced the value of your property.

So what you need to do is determine if your property is in an OZ, assuming that your phone is not already ringing off the hook with people telling you that it is. It takes a little futzing, but this map will allow you to enter an address and tell you whether it is an OZ. I have not checked it for accuracy, so use it at your own risk. OZs are defined in terms of census tracts, which are pretty small areas - essentially neighborhoods.

For Developers

This is like telling my grandmother how to suck eggs, but if your business is developing housing or commercial real estate, you should be aware that there is a pool of capital out there, that might make a project feasible depending on what side of the street it is on.

I spoke with a developer who was thinking about investing in a fund, because of a recent liquidity event, but is hanging back on that because of uncertainty about the 2026 capital gain rate. He told me that sites are already being promoted as located in opportunity zones.

For Tax Professionals

Because of the way it is likely to connect to financial statement issues, the tax work on OZ funds probably is pretty much a lock for CPAs. EAs and unenrolled preparers probably don't have much opportunity except insofar as their clients invest in OZ funds or own property in OZs.

If you are early in your career, what is the percentage in becoming your firm's OZ expert? It could turn out to be a dead end, but there is always the example of Mike Novogradac who took out a flyer on the historic credit and LIHTC and now runs a top fifty firm with his name on the door.

OZs are a temporary thing as the law now stands, but they have bipartisan support so they might have a much longer life.

I know that if I was still practicing, I would check the address of every property owned by every one of my clients and call up everybody who had anything in an OZ. It would not be hard to incorporate that with return prep.

For the most part, nothing would come of it, but people really appreciate that type of service. And as all those consultants for cost segregation will tell you, you don't want your client to hear it from some other CPA and have them wonder why they didn't hear it from you.

Good Policy?

Mike Novogradac thinks it is a really great idea to lower the cost of capital for the moribund census tracts. And of course, he has thought about it a lot more than I have. On the other hand, a good chunk of work will be coming his way, which might hurt his objectivity.

Take a look at the map again and zoom in on census tract 25025081200 and try to discern why that particular small section of Jamaica Plain should have a lower cost of capital than the area around it. I could see OZ designation fueling gentrification, which can be a good thing, if you are part of the gentry, but not so good if you are priced out of your old neighborhood

Mike indicated the support for the program is bipartisan so it may have life beyond 2026. Look for all the reports on OZ success stories. I'm sure they will be coming.

Other Coverage Resources

Novogradac has an Opportunity Zones Resource Center that you should look at if you want more depth.

Here is our Vice President in a Breitbart story celebrating an OZ success story.

“After 11 years of abandonment, the Capital 8 theater is a reality. And it’s creating jobs and opportunity and energy in this growing community,” Pence said to applause. “Opportunity Zones help address unique needs by forming partnerships between the federal government with regard to tax benefits, state and local leaders, and local investors to create that incentive that makes it even more possible for people to invest at the point of the need.”

Joshua Pollard just posted something on this platform about IRS hearings on regulations.

Matthew Goldstein and Jim Tankersley have a story in the New York Times about the money that is already flooding into OZ funds.

Distressed America is Wall Street’s hottest new investment vehicle. Hedge funds, investment banks and money managers are trying to raise tens of billions of dollars this year for so-called opportunity funds, a creation of President Trump’s 2017 tax package meant to steer money to poor areas by offering potentially large tax breaks.

forbes,3 Big Takeaways From The Standing-Room-Only Hearing On Opportunity Zones,"How often are 150 people turned away from an IRS hearing on Valentine's Day? Almost never. But in standing-room only fashion, the much anticipated public hearing on Opportunity Zones took place last week in Washington, D.C., after being delayed 35 days because of the partial government shutdown.

Three major takeaways stood out among the issues raised throughout the course of the five-hour-long hearing:

The 50% test for investing in a business has emerged as, arguably, the most important factor in the legislation right now. Why? If the IRS determines that 50% of the sales or gross income of a business that is taking on capital gains must be derived from within the Opportunity Zone in which it is located in order to qualify for an Opportunity Fund, that severely limits which and how many projects make for good investments.

Imagine a T-shirt design and printing company that operates in the rustbelt town of Braddock, Pennsylvania, known as the birthplace of Andrew Carnegie’s first steel plant. Today, most of Braddock is designated as a Qualified Opportunity Zone. In order for the T-shirt business to meet the 50% test standard that would designate it as a Qualified Opportunity Zone Business, half of its T-shirt sales would have to come from inside Braddock. Never mind the significant retail sales the T-shirt designer conducts online with buyers across state lines.

The 50% test plainly hamstrings businesses residing within OZ’s which seek qualification as OZ Businesses. Confining them to deriving 50% of sales from within the boundaries of their OZ creates little incentive for investors to want to put capital into them.

But there’s encouraging news for investors. “IRS asked a lot of follow-up questions about this issue,” says Stockton Williams, Executive Director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies. While affordable housing is the focus of those agencies, Williams recognizes, as do other Opportunity Zone advocates, the symbiotic relationship between investors and communities when it comes to redevelopment.

“I think IRS is thinking very hard about [the 50% test], and they need to look at what’s in the statue and what precedents exist elsewhere in the tax law. You need to first follow the statutes, but you need to be cognizant of how other similar provisions to the tax code apply and how they’ve dealt with similar matters, because they are important relationships throughout the code.”

IRS appears to be willing to treat businesses in a similar way to how it treats real estate, for working capital purposes. The substantial improvement provision

Any investor knows that a real estate project doesn't come together in a day. As such, this 2 ½-year safe harbor period was written into the OZ provision to allow private investors to fully invest in an improvement project.

But business investors want this same time allowance, too. Many of the questions at the public hearing circled around allowing businesses in Opportunity Zones to take advantage of the 30-month investment time frame, just as real estate investors can. Judging by the feedback at the public hearing, IRS seems positively inclined to allow investments in businesses this working capital safe harbor of 2 ½ years. This is very constructive, as business investments in the OZ legislation have taken significantly longer to come together than some of the more pioneering real estate OZ fund projects because of the cloudiness around regulations.

One group is saying, “Hurry up,” another is saying, “Hold on a minute,” and both are saying, “Don’t mess up.” 145 public comments

Investors from across the country who are able to participate in the tax incentive program recognize that the economics of Opportunity Zones become a little less valuable every day, given the hard stop date of December 2026 for realizing the tax deferral, so they’re hesitant to invest capital in Qualified Opportunity Zones over concern that the rules remain unclear.

Community-based organizations, too, are vocally concerned about how the tax cuts will or won’t create affordable housing and jobs for their residents. After all, Opportunity Zones were created as a part of the Tax Cuts AND Jobs Act. Yet advocates, through their lobbying efforts, express concern that the investments aren’t coming to fruition soon enough.

“Affordable housing issues are really important if Opportunity Zones are going to achieve their promise,” says Williams of NCSHA, “but the first order of business is getting final program rules from IRS that enable capital to start flowing. Until that’s done, I don’t think you’ll see a heavy volume of deals closing.”

The IRS, therefore, must balance a very slender line if they are going to make community investors happy and spur the job growth that Opportunity Zones were intended to create in a very short period. The grand message can be codified to one simple phrase: Please make it good for investors, please make it good for communities, and please hurry up.",2019,02,22,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuapollard/2019/02/22/3-big-takeaways-from-the-standing-room-only-hearing-on-opportunity-zones/

investmentnews,Opportunity-zone investments — are they right for your clients?,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in December 2017 included many changes to the tax code. One was the creation of ""opportunity zones"": state-designated and U.S. Treasury-approved areas where ""new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment.""

Opportunity zones are specifically designed to incentivize investment in economically distressed communities and, for investors, they offer some intriguing and potentially significant financial benefits.

For advisers, understanding the potential benefits of opportunity zones, and appreciating when they do and don't make sense as an investment, is critical.

(More: Fervor over 'opportunity zones' heats up)​

Broadly speaking, the opportunity-zone provision allows investors to defer taxes on a gain from the sale of an asset. There are some similarities between the tax benefits of opportunity-zone investments and those available under a 1031 exchange — where investors can defer capital gain and depreciation recapture taxes from a property sale if they reinvest the proceeds in a replacement property. But there are some significant differences as well.

While a 1031 exchange only permits tax deferral on the sale of investment real estate, opportunity-zone benefits apply to the sale of a range of assets, including real estate, a business or highly appreciated stock, and thus are potentially beneficial to a wider range of investors.

Opportunity zone real estate developments may offer a higher internal rate of return than investments in existing stabilized assets, but the nature of a development project means that investors aren't going to receive any cash flow for the first few years of the investment.

Additionally, after the initial deferral, investors have an opportunity for two modest step-ups in basis: 10% if the investment is held for five years and 15% after seven years (if the five- and seven-year periods end prior to Dec. 31, 2026).

If the investment in the project is held for 10 years, however, there are no capital gains or depreciation recapture taxes on that investment. This makes the longer-term IRR potential for opportunity zones, both pre- and after-tax, look attractive, but investors with liquidity needs or flexibility preferences inside of that 10-year time horizon should think carefully. The fit for an opportunity-zone investment should be evaluated on an investor-by-investor basis.

While there's no limit to how many 1031 exchanges an investor can execute — preserving the ability to continue deferring taxes until death — the initial gain deferred upon an investment in an opportunity zone becomes taxable on Dec. 31, 2026.

Certain product sponsors plan to return some capital through the refinancing of a project's construction loan to help with tax payments. Nonetheless, investors should keep enough liquid assets available to pay future taxes and not rely on a potential sponsor distribution. Additionally, because opportunity zones allow 180 days to reinvest, compared to just 45 days in a 1031 exchange, they can be a great option for investors who missed the chance for a 1031 exchange.

Advisers and investors alike should be careful not to let the tax tail wag the investment dog. Evaluate the quality of every investment independently, and don't make any decisions solely for tax benefits.

But for investors who have realized a substantial gain (and incurred a substantial tax bill), opportunity zones provide a chance to reinvest and allow those assets more time to make money — an appealing alternative to writing a large check to the government.

nytimes,"‘Opportunity Zones’ Offer Tax Breaks and, Maybe, Help for Communities","But the rules are complex, and the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service didn’t clarify many details until October; more guidance is still expected. The recent government shutdown didn’t help.

That said, opportunity funds are beginning to gain steam. The main questions for investors — such as what kind of investment gains are eligible for investment in an opportunity fund — generally have been answered, Mr. Miller said.

“The benefits are pretty significant,” Mr. Miller said.

Here’s how it works

Opportunity funds let investors postpone federal taxes on recent capital gains until the end of 2026; they can also reduce the taxable portion of those gains by as much as 15 percent, after seven years. Further, investors can eliminate taxes on additional gains from investing in the fund itself, if they hold the investment for 10 years.

So, if you have investments that have appreciated, you can defer capital gains taxes by selling the investment and reinvesting the money into an opportunity fund within six months. Almost any sort of capital gain qualifies, whether from the sale of stocks or mutual funds, or other investments, including the sale of real estate or a business. (One investor in Fundrise’s opportunity fund, Mr. Miller said, invested a gain from the sale of a dialysis clinic.)

Just the gains on an investment — rather than the entire proceeds of a sale — must be reinvested in the opportunity fund. That’s “highly unusual” and one reason opportunity funds may appear attractive, said Jeffrey Levine, chief executive of BluePrint Wealth Alliance.

Say you sold stock for $500,000, and $300,000 of it was a gain. Just $300,000 must be rolled into the opportunity fund and the remaining $200,000 can be used as the seller wishes, according to an example provided by Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Wealth Solutions Group, part of Robert W. Baird & Company.

By putting money in the fund, investors not only delay having to pay tax, but are also eligible for a partial exclusion of the tax on the reinvested gains. If you remain in the fund for five years, you will reduce the taxable gain by 10 percent; if you hold it an additional two years, for seven total, you will further reduce the taxable gain by another 5 percent.",2019,02,15,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/opportunity-zone-tax-break-controversy.html
barrons,What to Know About Opportunity Zones as Investors Rush to Claim a New Tax Break,"Text size

From food deserts in rural Oregon to crumbling neighborhoods in East Baltimore, investors are channeling assets into low-income areas across the U.S. to take advantage of a major new tax incentive under the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.

The new law lets investors defer and reduce taxes on realized capital gains by reinvesting them in areas designated as “opportunity zones.” And potentially even more significant, taxes can be avoided altogether on gains accrued on the new investments if they’re held for the long term.

Guidance on how this incentive works was issued by the Treasury Department late last year, triggering both a flurry of deal-making between investment managers and real estate developers to create investment vehicles called opportunity zone funds, and a flood of capital from investors eager to get into the funds.

The benefits could be far reaching for investors. There are no limits on how much capital gains can be invested in opportunity zone funds, and return potential can be greater than the average real estate investment because many opportunity zone values haven’t been driven up.

But there are plenty of scenarios in which both the tax and investment results can fall far short of investors’ expectations, and advisors urge investors to tread cautiously.

“This sounds great from a tax and socially responsible standpoint,” says Michael Grenon, a principal at Grimes & Co., a wealth management firm in Westborough, Mass. “But investors need to have clarity about the merits of the investments and how they’re structured.”

Investments can either be in a single real estate development—say, an apartment complex in midtown Detroit—or in a basket of different deals in a number of opportunity zones.

When investors transfer realized gains to opportunity zone funds, taxes on the gains are deferred. If the investment is held for five years, the cost basis on the transferred gains is stepped up by 10%. After seven years, the cost basis bumps up another 5%. After 10 years, any gains on the opportunity zone investment are exempt from capital gains taxes.

While there are no explicit minimum investments, opportunity zone funds have the characteristics of a private equity or debt deal. They tie assets up for the long term, charge significantly higher fees than the average mutual fund, and require an experienced manager who understands the nuances of the distressed real estate market to pinpoint good investment prospects, says Daryl Deke, CEO of New Market Wealth Management. “You have to be careful” he says. “In some cases managers are getting into this without the experience.”

Opportunity zones were designated based on 2010 Census data, with input from governors and others, resulting in a broad mix of areas in different stages of revitalization. “A lot has changed in some areas since 2010. By no means are all opportunity zones created equal,” says Leon LaBrecque, an advisor at Sequoia Financial Group. “Some areas are dead zones you wouldn’t want to invest in, others clearly aren’t. Each project has to be evaluated on its own merits.”

Charles Clinton, CEO of New York-based commercial real estate investment firm EquityMultiple, which is in the midst of launching an opportunity zone fund, points out that even for seasoned real estate investment managers, finding developers who are experienced specifically in low income areas is challenging.

“You want developers who were already working in opportunity zones before the tax benefits came out, and understand an area’s potential,” Clinton says. “Some opportunity zones aren’t ready yet for new multi-family developments because there just isn’t enough demand, but in those cases an industrial project might work and bring in other business.”

His firm’s fund will invest in a mix of residential and commercial developments in opportunity zones outside of Phoenix, Ariz., and in the South Bronx in New York, among other areas.

One of the more delicate issues with opportunity zone investing is timing: There are strict rules. Investors have 180 days to invest realized capital gains in an opportunity zone fund. If gains are realized in stages, this can get messy, says Katherine Rosa, global head of alternative investments for JPMorgan Wealth Management.

“If you have a concentrated stock position with gains, you may be selling over time to coincide with when a manager calls capital for projects,” Rosa says. “The 180 day start may be staggered. It can be complicated to manage.”

Fund managers also have constraints. They must substantially improve a property within 30 months of taking on capital, and 90% of capital in a fund must be invested in an opportunity zone.

One risk is that a manager takes on capital too quickly, without enough projects in the pipeline, Clinton says. “There will be cases where managers will go for the money first, and think about the projects later,” he says. “We work on a project by project basis, matching money to an investable deal.”

Expect annual investment management fees of 1.5% to 2% or more on opportunity zone funds, and incentive fees that will eat up a part of the return over a specified rate.

After fees, Rosa sees potential for high single-digit or low double-digit returns. “Think of these as diversifiers from your core holdings,” she says. She added that investors who may be overly focused on the tax benefit need a good manager who won’t let potential tax savings dictate how to handle underlying investments.

“If a manager could lock in a 20% return but it would mean selling a property before the 10 years is up, the manager might view that as the best investing move and has the ability to do that,” Rosa says. “Fundamentally, this needs to be about good quality investments.”

forbes,Opportunity Zones Investors Receive Needed Guidance For Measurable Impact,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created a new investment incentive for low-income communities called Opportunity Zones. Under the new rules, capital gains can be sheltered from tax when invested in Qualified Opportunity Funds.

According to the IRS, low-income community must be nominated by the state and approved by the U.S. Treasury to become an Opportunity Zone. Thousands of communities have already been approved. See the list here.

The IRS simply defines Qualified Opportunity Funds as “an investment vehicle that is set up as either a partnership or corporation for investing in eligible property that is located in a Qualified Opportunity Zone.”

The law does not specifically require that the investment have a measurable social impact—or any social impact—for that matter, apparently presuming that all investment in Opportunity Zones is a good investment.

The U.S. Impact Investing Alliance and Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, fearing that not all investments have a positive impact on the communities have developed a framework for Opportunity Zone investing and impact measurement.

“Opportunity Zones represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to spur private investment into America’s distressed communities. However, in order for us to achieve the transformational impact we hope for, such as equitable growth and economic opportunity, it is important that those entering this market remain committed to transparency and community engagement,” said Fran Seegull, executive director of the U.S. Impact Investing Alliance.

The Framework has three principal parts: guiding principles, reporting framework and guidelines for measuring impact and outcomes.

The framework document offers five guiding principles:

Community Engagement: Opportunity Fund investors should request that fund managers integrate the needs of local communities into the formation and implementation of the funds, reaching low‐income and underinvested communities with attention to diversity. Equity: Opportunity Fund investments should seek to generate equitable community benefits, leverage other incentives and aim for responsible exits. Transparency: Opportunity Fund investors should be transparent and hold themselves accountable, with processes and practices that remain fair and clear. Measurement: Opportunity Fund investors should voluntarily monitor, measure and track progress against specific impact objectives, identifying key outcome measures and allowing for continuous improvement. Outcomes: Opportunity Fund metrics should track real change, with an understanding that both quantitative and qualitative measures are valuable indicators of progress.

The reporting framework is intended to apply across a wide range of investors and audiences. The document says, “The Opportunity Zones Reporting Framework contains criteria that represent the shared, common and collective metrics that should be utilized by all stakeholders across the Opportunity Zones landscape.”

The impact and outcomes measurement is defined as a shared objective and suggests that funds define their intended impact up front and measure the corresponding outcomes. For instance, a fund that seeks to invest in entrepreneurs based in the Opportunity Zone should, of course, measure and report on the number of new ventures within it over time.

“The only way we will know if the Opportunity Zones policy is effective is by continuously measuring and proactively evaluating the long-term outcomes,” said Lisa Hall, Fellow in Residence at the Beeck Center. “To truly be successful, we should see measurable evidence of social and economic benefits that accrue to the people who live and work in the Opportunity Zones. This framework is meant to guide investors, fund managers and community stakeholders to make sure that they are contributing to that shared goal.”",2019,02,11,https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2019/02/11/opportunity-zones-investors-receive-needed-guidance-for-measurable-impact/

therealdeal,Anthony Scaramucci,"Anthony Scaramucci may be best known for his 11 tumultuous days as President Donald Trump’s White House communications director, before he got the axe from then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in July 2017. That was the first time Kelly and Scaramucci had met. The fast-talking 55-year-old financier, whose recent appearance on “Celebrity Big Brother” lasted just six days, now has his eyes on the real estate industry. His hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, plans to raise an outsized $3 billion Opportunity Zones fund, hoping to seize on the popularity of the federal tax incentive program and deploy capital into developments across the country. SkyBridge, which Scaramucci founded in 2005 after stints at Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, has $9.7 billion in assets under management. The firm took a hit last spring when talks to sell to the Chinese conglomerate HNA fell apart. In a wide-ranging, two-hour interview in his Madison Avenue office, Scaramucci offered his thoughts on why the HNA deal and his White House tenure imploded and why he thinks his recent real estate foray is a sound bet. The Mooch, which he has no problem calling himself, also spoke candidly about whether Trump is good for the country and what happened the second time he met Kelly.

DOB: Jan. 6, 1964

Lives in: Manhasset, New York

Hometown: Port Washington, New York

Family: Remarried with five children

How did the Scaramuccis arrive in New York? My grandmother and my grandfather settled in Port Washington in the 1920s. They had my mom in 1937. My father was born in 1935. He came to that town from Pennsylvania.

How’d they meet? At a soda shop. He took a 5 to 9 p.m. shift at the soda counter, and my mother walks in there with her high school friends. I think he was serving her. He was a couple of years older than them, and he invited them to drive out to Jones Beach. He gets an effing flat tire on the way there. And my mother’s mouthing off to him while he’s trying to change tire.

Is [your mother] feisty? Oh my God, she’s nuts. You know, the tabloid press is descending on me like locusts because I’ve been blown from the White House. They want to see the car crash. So they’re waiting outside my mother’s house, and now they decide they’re going to knock on my mother’s door. They’re coming with the camera and the lights. My mother bursts open the door. She says, “Get the fuck off my lawn.” I said, “Ma! You can’t do that, that’s what got me in trouble in the White House.” That’s everything you need to know about my crazy Italian family.

I have noticed you make a point of saying that you went Harvard. Why is that? Arriviste. You have to understand something: You’re being profiled. I’m being profiled. So when somebody on late night television is trying to equate me to the Jersey Shore because I’m Italian, or to the Mafia, I say, “Guys, time out a second. I went to Harvard Law School, okay?”

How come you didn’t go on to practice law afterward? Hated it.

But that’s what got you to Goldman? That’s what got me to Goldman.

You were hired, then fired, then re-hired at Goldman? Yes. Totally. You know, John Kelly was sitting in here [in January]. I said: “You’re not the first person to fire me. You probably won’t be the last person to fire me.”

Was he just dropping by, or …? No, I called him. I said, “Hey, I want you to speak at my conference.” I’m going to interview him on stage. You like that move? That guy fired my ass, humiliated me in the international press, blew me out of the White House. Maybe the shortest-tenured White House official in U.S. history. I got blown to smithereens. I did make a mistake, by the way, and what I told Kelly is: “What I did was fireable, I just wish you would’ve fired me differently.”

Have you spoken to [Ryan Lizza] since [that expletive-ridden phone call right before you got fired]? I will never speak to him again.

During your time at Lehman Brothers in the 2000s, was the writing on the wall? I did not think so. I’m going to tell you something that’s very, very honest. I had stock options at Lehman. When I left to start SkyBridge … I asked the Lehman compensation committee to allow me to keep my options. And they said, “no.” And thank God they did.

You also got hit by the financial crisis. So that’s what changed SkyBridge. We’ve got $300 million under management. We had $500 [million]. I land in Melbourne, Australia, on Sept. 16, 2008. The world is in crisis. The markets are in turmoil. And I cut a deal with Challenger Financial to keep the company alive. I sell them 10 percent of our equity and they put in $100 million to bolster the fund. So now I get my ass handed to me. Now I’ve got to figure out how to make the business survive. So I start [SkyBridge Alternatives Conference], because everybody and their mother has money from the federal government.

What was the idea behind this? It was March 10, 2009. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Citibank are canceling their conferences. Goldman literally moves its conference from Las Vegas to San Francisco.

Why? Barack Obama comes on the television, and he says, “Now’s not the time to go to Vegas, or to be flying in your private plane.”

And so where did you have yours? Las Vegas. I said, “Okay, these guys are all leaving Vegas. You can blow a cannonball through these hotel rooms.” Total contrarian move. And by the way, I make the move not because I’m brilliant. I make the move because I have nothing to lose. What’s the worst that can happen? My business is going out of business, I have a farewell party in Las Vegas. Or I catch the bottom, and I look like a genius.

[Okay, let’s talk politics.] I’m way left of center socially. I got Caitlyn Jenner at my conference. I supported gay rights. I supported equal marriage in New York. I’m a donor to the American Unity PAC, which is Republicans for gay marriage and civil rights equality.

Did that create tension for you once you were revolving around the Republican Party? Oh, yeah. That’s a big bone of contention. By the way, I would maintain to you that Trump was probably left of center and he had to switch positions in order to get the nomination.

You think he has changed his ideologies? I don’t think so. I think he has to say that he’s changed, for political purposes. He went to Elton John’s wedding. You think Trump cares who marries who? These [evangelical] Republicans are ridiculous. They’re for a smaller government everywhere in this society except your bedroom. It’s a hypocritical, asinine thing.

[You discussed briefly with Obama, at an event, who was going to win the 2016 election. He said he thought Clinton was going to win.] Most of us did. Anybody that tells you in the Trump campaign that they thought Trump was winning is telling you a fib, okay? Particularly after the “Access Hollywood” tape.

What’s your take on that whole saga? The “Access Hollywood” thing? I’m not a conspiracy theorist, but I think that they had that bomb on him. And I think they somehow misfired. Basically, what happened there, Trump being Trump …

What does that mean? Trump has a very unique personality. He is arguably one of the most successful politicians in American history, but he spent 68 years of his life actually not being a politician. So Trump being Trump is, he’s a dilettante. He’s a billionaire playboy. He’s gone and had three marriages. He’s got five children from three different women. This is outside of what I would call the evangelical orbit.

Tell me about the time you first met Trump. I met him when I was 31 years old, still working at Goldman. One of my old bosses introduced me to him. And because he was Donald Trump, and I was a 31-year-old kid with school debt, it left a very big impression on me, and I guarantee you it left no impression on him. I become an acquaintance of his, [around] 2010, because he’s on NBC and I’m a signed contributor to CNBC.

So you walked past each other in the hallways? No, I get invited to parties that he’s a part of. There’s an “Apprentice” party he’s hosting. I get invited to that party. I’m not a “friend” of his.

Fast forward to the last election. He does two fundraisers in his apartment. I work on those fundraisers, with Michael Cohen, by the way … I’m on TV a lot, talking about the new administration. The president then offers me the OPL [Office of Public Liaison] position. I accept that. I actually showed Kelly the signed offer acceptance letter. [Steve] Bannon tried to say that I never got the job offer.

Is Bannon personally against you? Well, I think he is now. We go pretty hard after each other now. Back then, I think that he was actually supportive of me … I had a good relationship with Steve. But he turned. Him and Priebus were an unholy alliance. Biggest mistake Trump has made thus far is making Reince Priebus [his] chief of staff.

Why? Because Reince hates Trump. And so he flooded the administration with RNC people that were disloyal to the president’s agenda. They didn’t want him to win the nomination. Trump needed more people that were not willing to alter their behavior.

Do you think he still needs people like that? Of course he does, he’s got a bunch of sycophants. You know that.

Is there a different Scaramucci in public, and on television, “Big Brother,” and then as a serious hedge fund operator? It’s the exact same person. It’s just that I’m an eclectic person. I’ve had to take a lot of risks to get to where I am. Why did I go on “Celebrity Big Brother”? I think that rich people have detached themselves from what’s actually going on in America. I spent 29 years creating some level of financial independence and security for my family. And a result of which, I’m in the echo chamber now of the very wealthy.

What is your position on the #MeToo movement? Trump-related. Spawned and created by Trump … As a reaction against him. If you’re Bill Clinton, and you’re “perceived to be progressive with women,” you can have oral sex just outside the Oval Office and there’s no #MeToo movement. But if you’re Donald J. Trump, and you’re perceived by that movement to be against them, and you’re riding around on the bus with Billy Bush, we can’t take you out because you’re elected for four years, but we’re going to take these other people out.

Do you think Trump is good for America? I think there are aspects of Trump that are very good for America; there’s aspects of Trump that are very bad for America.

Explain that? Yeah. If you took Trump’s policies, which are by and large commonsense in their orientation, and you extract his delivery and elements of his style, that would be way better for America. The coarseness and bellicosity of his style is holding him back on the approval rating, and it’s jarring America … You can’t say that the press is the enemy of the people. You can’t attack people personally on Twitter.

How did you meet your current wife, Deidre? Deidre worked here [at SkyBridge]. She was the head of investor relations.

It was reported that you two are now back together. We reconnected after I got fired [from the White House]. We were on the verge of getting divorced. We actually went to fucking divorce court, and we got perp-walked by the New York Post. Brutal. After that, I went to see her. I said, “Look, I’m still in love with you. If you want to try to figure out a way to put this back together, I would like to do that.”

Was that a tumultuous period of life for you? I’m not sanitizing it: I put my pride and my ego into my decision-making. The minute that Priebus and Bannon blocked me from the OPL job, I locked and loaded on the two of them. I was absolutely stupid. When your emotions are running high, your intelligence is running low. Don’t ever forget that, okay?

How many homes do you have? I have three. One in Manhasset, one in Southampton, and a place in Windham, New York, in the Catskills.

[And what about your newest venture?] How did you get into Opportunity Zones? When I got back to SkyBridge, two of my partners were already working on an Opportunity Zone fund for EJF Capital. And I said okay, that’s great! Because I know a lot about this and we can get some insight from Treasury, blah blah blah.

You are seeking to raise $3 billion. Right, I don’t think that’s ambitious. I think we can do a billion each year based on what I know of available demand for the product. But let me tell you something: If you don’t speak and talk that way, you’re not going to get it done.

You said you’ve raised $28 million so far. We see this as a very slow ramp from the beginning of the year. I think we could easily raise that kind of money, knowing the demand that’s out there. Our traditional vendors are UBS, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James. They would put us on their platform, and then there are tens of thousands of financial advisers that can go and recommend our REIT. If we can get on one of the platforms, then yes, I can’t see why we won’t have $1 billion [this year]. If we can’t get onto one of the platforms, we will probably do about $300 [million] to $500 million.

How do you plan to invest in the Opportunity Zones? It’s going to be primarily development … A lot of what we will be doing is ground-up or knocking something down and then rebuilding it. There’s 8,700 zones; the guys that we we’re working with, they have a 15-year track record, they have offices in L.A. and in Connecticut. I think the specific emphasis for us will be the West Coast, and New England down the Atlantic.

Why did EJF and SkyBridge split? They had a fund that they were running. We set up a restructure to make it more available to retail investors, or what I would call the mass affluent. And they wanted to simultaneously be our sub-advisers on the REIT and run their fund. We wanted it to be in one unit.

Why weren’t they willing to do that? I think they were willing to do that once they got to a certain number.

So prior, and other than the stint you did with Goldman, have you had any other experience with real estate financing? I backed Westport Capital Partners, my sub-adviser. In 2006, I seeded them with money and went out and raised them their first billion dollars. So they’re friends of mine. Fully disclosed, we have a small ownership stake in their original fund; we don’t have an ownership stake in their company.

Last year, SkyBridge was to be sold to Chinese firm HNA, but that fell apart. What happened? Before the talks broke off, there was a negative story about HNA every single week in the press. When we announced our merger was over, have you seen that many negative stories on HNA?

What are you suggesting? Washington has made a decision to intensify activity on merger activity with Chinese institutions. It’s got a lot tougher to get these things through.

Then what happened? The deal didn’t go through, so I’m back in my ownership position at SkyBridge like nothing changed. We lost a couple of billion dollars as a result of it, we’re getting it back now. Performance has been great.

Okay, and on a final note: What’s your biggest vice? I over-talk.

forbes,Find Your Investment Opportunity In An Opportunity Zone,"By now, you’ve probably heard the term ""Opportunity Zones"" more times than you can count. But if you haven't dug deeper, you may not know how this program can affect you as a real estate investor. Let’s start with an overview of how it all works.

You can invest any kind of capital gain into a Qualified Opportunity Fund. As long as the Qualified Opportunity Fund is buying qualified property inside the fund, there are a number of tax advantages available to investors. Qualified property is any piece of real estate, corporate security or real property used and operated inside an Opportunity Zone (OZ).

This means that capital gains from the sale of a business, stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies or any other type of investment can be placed into a Qualified Opportunity Fund, and the owed tax on that gain will be deferred for seven years. This alone is great news.

But it gets better. Your basis in the original gain increases by 10% after seven years and another 5% after 10 years, for a total of 15% increase in your basis. This reduces the size of your original gain and causes you to pay less total tax due to this “step up” in basis. And, all the money that investors earn on the gain itself during the 10-year holding period is not taxed at all.

Let’s say you have a $100,000 gain. You invest it for 10 years into a Qualified Opportunity Fund and get your taxable basis increased to $85,000, improved by 15%. Then if you earned $50,000 on this $100,000 after 10 years, you would pay zero tax on the $50,000 gain — that's pretty amazing.

So how are real estate investors reacting to this? They’re chasing great OZ real estate transactions. And, since many OZs are located within already gentrifying neighborhoods, markets like my home base of Nashville are seeing even faster accelerating demand for land in these areas.

The typical profile of an OZ real estate investor is someone who is interested in tax savings, wealth-building and preservation with a medium- to long-term hold period. Consequently, the number of build-and-hold, ground-up development projects is increasing, as this is one of the best avenues for realizing higher yields over a longer (expected 10-year) term.

Now, instead of investors analyzing ground-up development deals based on a for-sale basis (18- to 36-month project timeline) or a buy-and-hold basis (five- to seven-year hold), the project pro-forma, and thus internal rate of return (IRR), needs to work over a 10-year time frame.

The establishment of OZs and the resulting new class of investors is creating several interesting effects on the market, in my observation. These include:

• More emotional sellers results in over-inflated property prices, as sellers with properties located in OZs get dollar signs in their eyes and think the value of their land has just doubled, when in reality it has not.

• More inexperienced players are entering the investment arena. Real estate is the simplest to access and the most straightforward type of qualified property, so a large portion of the gains being placed into Qualified Opportunity Funds is going to be used to purchase real estate.

For example, if you have $10,000,000 of gains from selling your business, you want something safe for your retirement, so the best choice for a “safe investment” that satisfies the definition of a qualified property is likely to be real estate inside an OZ.

• More capital allocation is being placed into real estate than would otherwise traditionally be allocated due to the potential tax savings. People who would have otherwise purchased stocks and bonds with their capital gain proceeds will be incentivized to place it in real estate instead.

• Fewer condominiums and more apartment buildings will be built. As strange as that may sound, fewer condos will be built in some markets, as expensive land that otherwise only made sense for condominiums is being purchased for long-term build-and-hold multifamily projects instead.

• There will be less focus on fundamentals and more “bad deals” being done by investors as the ""fear of missing out"" mentality overshadows sound investment principles, especially later in the economic cycle where staying in strong primary and secondary markets near the urban core is the prudent move to make.

Also worth noting is that established private equity groups that are now making OZ investments have successfully raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few months alone, so the amount of available capital is only increasing. However, since the tax benefit must be passed through directly to investors, syndicating money on a deal-by-deal basis may make more sense than pooling money into a larger fund.

For investors to intelligently participate the OZ program, they must:

1. Focus on strong primary and secondary markets, avoiding lower-tier markets.

2. Focus on projects where local demand is strong.

3. Focus on product types where supply is constrained (not oversupplied).

4. Invest near the urban cores of these stronger markets.

5. Work with proven developers with strong local market presences.

jacksonnewspapers,Officials: Opportunity Zone will boost economic development,"Economic development professionals are excited about the recent creation of an Opportunity Zone in Ravenswood and Millwood.

The Opportunity Zones program in West Virginia was created as part of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, but economic development professionals, potential investors, and advisors are still learning how they might best be utilized for their communities, according to a statement released recently by the Jackson County Development Authority.

“The idea behind an Opportunity Zone is to incentivize individuals who own an asset … to sell that asset and invest those capital gains in designated areas,” said attorney John Stump, of Steptoe & Johnson in Charleston, during a recent presentation at the West Virginia Economic Development Association.

Capital gains are earned when an investment — such as a stock or building — increases in value. It’s estimated that there are trillions of dollars in unrealized capital in the United States because of investors holding on to assets, Stump said.

“A lot of properties have been owned by families for generations because they don’t want to incur the capital gains (tax),” Stump said.

Opportunity Zones seek to draw out that money by allowing the taxes to be deferred until the end of 2026 if the gains are invested, within 180 days, in a project in a designated zone, according to the JCDA.

The tax rate is discounted by 10 percent after five years and a total of 15 percent after seven. If the investor holds the new investment for 10 years, there is no tax on its capital gains for that period, JCDA officials said.

“If somebody has an idea for a business and you want to start a business, boy, you sure would want to do it in an Opportunity Zone,” Stump said. “If the property goes up in value, at the end of the day, (you have) enormous upside potential.”

The governor’s office designated 55 opportunity zones across the state last year, two of them in Jackson County. One includes the Millwood area and the City of Ravenswood.

JCDA director Mark Whitley Director said Millwood and Ravenswood were recommended for the zone because of excellent opportunities for future development.

“Having an opportunity zone in place provides another economic tool and financial incentive to help support business development,” said Whitley.

To invest capital gains in an Opportunity Zone, a Qualified Opportunity Fund must be created, he said.

“There are banks that have half-a-billion-dollar funds targeting opportunity zones,” Stump said. “It can (also) be as simple as a limited liability company with just one member.”

According to Whitley, the primary benefits of Opportunity Zones are:

• Deferral: An investor can defer taxes on capital gains until 2026 by investing realized gains in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.

• Reduction: Tax liability on deferred gains is reduced by 10 percent at five years and an additional 5 percent at seven years.

There are a wide range of acceptable opportunity zone investments, including startups, warehousing, manufacturing, affordable housing, hotels, restaurants and office development, Stump said.

“It must be an equity investment,” Stump said. “You can’t make a loan.”",2019,02,27,https://www.jacksonnewspapers.com/news/20190227/officials-opportunity-zone-will-boost-economic-development
commercialobserver,Will Opportunity Zones in California Be Golden?,"To those outside California, it might be perplexing that the state treasurer, Fiona Ma, got the loudest applause during her keynote address at the NES Financial-sponsored Opportunity Zone Expo for simply proclaiming that when it came to opportunity zones, the state would abide by the federal government tax statute. But California has always gone its own way when it comes to taxing capital gains income.

“California is open for business. We are behind some of the other states that have been doing a little bit more… but we are going to be catching up pretty quickly,” Ma said during her address before a sold-out crowd at the JW Marriott Los Angeles L.A. Live in Downtown Los Angeles last month, before outlining a “culture shift” to a more business-friendly approach. in Sacramento. Some might attribute the culture change to the ongoing lack of affordable housing in the state and, interconnected homeless crisis and the newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s campaign pledge to build 3.5 million homes from the time he takes office through 2025.

Partnering with private commercial developers, enticed by the added tax benefits—and helping streamline the entitlement and zoning process—would obviously be key to creating multifamily housing in a timely fashion.

It wasn’t surprising to attorney Michael Pruter, a partner at Allen Matkins, that Ma got such a rousing response to her proclamation. California taxes all capital gains as regular income, unlike the federal government, which differentiates between ordinary income and long- and short-term capital gains for tax purposes. Unlike at the federal level, that means Californians will be taxed at a rate anywhere from between 1 to 13.3 percent, depending on one’s tax bracket.

“A large part of California’s tax base is driven by high-net worth taxpayers who have capital gains,” Pruter, a member of the firm’s opportunity zone specialty team, told Commercial Observer. “Traditionally, the taxpayer realizes large capital gains through stock and then pays California income taxes. Governor Newsom’s budget notes the difficulty of forecasting personal income tax revenue in California due to significant reliance of the general fund on capital gains paid by a small portion of California taxpayers, noting that in 2016 the top 1 percent of income earners paid just under 46 percent of personal income taxes.”

Newsom’s initial state budget, announced on Jan. 10, however, gave glimmers of what California’s compliance with federal capital gains exclusions for opportunity zone investments, could involve.

“It’s a little vague about how broad that conformity is,” Pruter said. “It’s listed in the budget as dealing specifically with affordable housing and green technologies, renewable technologies. It’s unclear whether that applies to all the benefits of the statute or applies only to those two specific areas invested within California as opposed to a U.S. California taxpayer that invests in doing business outside the state. We’re all looking to see if that changes with the new governor and his budget.” Pruter was referring to the final enacted budget to be passed by the California legislature and signed into law by Newsom this summer.

Opportunity zones have been a source of heightened attention since they were created under the December 2017 federal tax reform. The provision allows investors who’ve earned capital gains in any line of business to reinvest the income in real estate projects in one of the 8,700 distressed zones the Treasury Department approved last year, deferring taxes on those gains, or, if they are held for 10 years, waived completely. The Internal Revenue Service released a first round of proposed regulations and guidelines for opportunity zones in October 2018, with a second public hearing expected to happen last month, then delayed due to the partial government shutdown.

Finally, the public hearing occurred yesterday, a Valentine’s gift perhaps to the bevy of private sector suitors awaiting further guidance on the subject. During the five-hour hearing, more than two dozen stakeholders shared their concerns over issues including the lack of clarity over whether a fund could sell individual assets it invests in and redeploy them to additional opportunity zones without losing the tax benefits, the tight six-month window in which such funds have to deploy capital before being penalized and the need to loosen restrictions on funds investing in businesses versus just real estate located in the zones, according to Bisnow.

The IRS will release its second round of regulations in the coming months.

As eager as private investors are to enter the fray, there obviously is still uncertainty as to how to reap the most gains—and tax benefits—from the program, especially in California, which is notorious for the time it can take to entitle commercial development projects. Under the federal plan, investors have a mere six months from realizing a capital gain to invest it in an opportunity zone. After that, properties in which the fund invests, either directly or indirectly, must either be “substantially improved” within 30 months or have their original use commence with the opportunity fund in the opportunity zone.

Yet the opportunity—and need—in California, which has 879 of the 8,700 underserved zones identified and, more ignominiously a state beset by an affordable housing and homeless crisis, is huge.

Shlomi Ronen, a managing principal and founder of Dekel Capital in Los Angeles, said the entitlement process is always a challenge in California, whether for an opportunity zone project or otherwise.

“In major markets in California like Los Angeles, from the time you buy land to putting a shovel in the ground on the fast side can take two years and that’s if the property is zoned for what you want to develop,” he said. “In Texas, for comparison it would happen within six months.”

That’s obviously puts even more time pressure on meeting opportunity zone investment guidelines in the Golden State.

As a consequence, Ronen said investors interested in entering the opportunity-zone market will be seeking projects that are already entitled—and the owners of those properties will be charging a premium for them.

“The premium is equal to the tax savings and tax free gains that one would get,” he said. “So, for example, if someone thought they could get a conventional development deal built to a certain return on costs and the savings from the deferral of capital gains along with the tax free gains amounted to 75 basis points then they could pay more for the land in an opportunity zone and get to the same after tax returns.”

Douglas Bystry, the president and CEO of Orange County-based Clearinghouse CDFI, which has been a lender for low-income community projects nationwide for the past 22 years, said one way around the time crunch is to look at expanding and improving properties that already exist in an opportunity zone.

“If you are just starting out with a new project, it could take a year to entitle, easily, but remember, too, this program works very well for existing businesses in low-income communities that want to expand,” he said. “And the processes to get building permits to expand are very different. A lot of it depends on—does the project require a zone change or things of that nature.”

The receptiveness of local officials and public support can also help streamline the development process. “There are a lot of communities in California that are aware of this program that we are working with that want to put the opportunity fund money into their communities,” Bystry said. “They are fast-tracking zoning, building permits, all the entitlements that might otherwise slow down the process.”

That said, he has found city council members in smaller communities are not always versed on how the actual program works.

“They felt that just because of [they had opportunity zones] all this federal money was going to drop from the sky and they were going to be able to spend it and do whatever they want,” Bystry said. “It doesn’t work that way. There has to be good solid projects and, in our opinion, they have to be projects that provide a very good return to our investors and have a tangible impact in the communities that we serve.”

Yusef Robb, a senior adviser to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and the nonprofit Accelerator for America, is well aware of the disconnect between the investment knowledge base of the public and private sectors.

“According to the Feds, [this could amount to] a $100 billion investment pool that could and should create positive change in some of our nation’s in-need communities. The question is, will they?” he said. “That’s where we’re stepping in. We want to help local communities steer these investments to not just provide a return for the investor, but also a return for the community.”

To do so, the nonprofit, which aims at providing strategic support to local initiatives on job and infrastructure, announced the launch of the California Opportunity Zone Partnership last week. (Garcetti chairs the accelerator’s advisory board, which is made up of business leaders and public officials including several U.S. mayors.) Partners include the State of California, Energy Foundation and the Cities of Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles, with the goal of educating public officials on opportunity zone best practices and how to work with private investors to identify and fund projects of the highest need and value in their local communities.

“I can build a hipster hotel, but will that return for the community be as much as another use, probably not,” Robb said. “But the private sector is never going to do that research, that’s just not their thing. We’re training up our cities to be able to go to investors and say, ‘here’s a project you should be doing,’ in a way that provides a return for the investor. Let’s meet them halfway and be a participant when it comes to the allocation of these investments to achieve as many win-wins as possible.”

Time, as it is overall with opportunity zones, he said, is critical. But, unlike private investors, eagerly awaiting upcoming guidance from the federal government, which was delayed due to the partial shutdown this winter, Robb sees the benefit of the pause.

“This is a good time that we can use to get cities ready to rock and roll because when the rates get finalized, then that’s when the private sector is going to go nuts,” he said.",2019,02,17,https://commercialobserver.com/2019/02/will-opportunity-zones-in-california-be-golden/
forbes,Turning Opportunity Zones Into Real Opportunities With Launch Pad,"Opportunity Zones are the new frontier of economic development. Authorized by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017—and proposed several years earlier by the Economic Innovation Group—Opportunity Zones have caught the fancy of mayors, economic development agencies, private investors, philanthropic foundations, and, inevitably, consultants.

For good reason: Opportunity Zones offer perhaps the best chance for the United States to finally get place-based policy right. History is not encouraging: prior attempts, including Enterprise Zones and Empowerment Zones and others, were underwhelming in their impact (but not their cost). Economists and others had boiled down the experience with place-based policy to a simple dictum: invest in people, not places.

Yet Opportunity Zones might actually be different, thanks in part to their relative simplicity in terms of requirements. The enthusiasm with which they have been taken up all over the country is one indication of the high level of expectation. In a nutshell, Opportunity Zones open up a pathway for private investors to put money into economically-challenged communities, through a variety of tax benefits for the capital invested and gained, conditional on meeting certain requirements. Neighborhoods bereft of investment will (ideally) enjoy an influx of private capital, and investors will earn a nice return. Everybody wins.

There are, of course, skeptics. Some worry that only high-end real estate development will attract investment. Others worry that existing residents of designated Opportunity Zones will not benefit from the potential influx of new wealth and jobs. To allay these concerns, some people have established new entities to help match capital with opportunity, and help funnel investment to high-return projects in high-need areas that might be overlooked. In Alabama, for example, Alex Flachsbart established Opportunity Alabama to do exactly that.

What will really fulfill the economic development promise of Opportunity Zones is an on-ground mechanism to enable investors to support local entrepreneurs. New and young companies are the lifeblood of neighborhoods and cities—they are the principal source of new job creation and become the bedrock businesses for residents. Opportunity Zones could potentially fuel business creation and growth, offering a much-needed boost to economic dynamism in areas where dynamism has largely disappeared. If those new businesses are structured in a certain way—through employee ownership, for example—the social and economic returns would be considerable.

How can this be realized? How can the deal flow be aggregated for investors? And, most importantly, how can those local entrepreneurs be supported beyond just capital?

One organization, Launch Pad, could be the best operating business example to deliver on the promise of the Opportunity Zone legislation and might just be the critical conduit by which Opportunity Zones renew American entrepreneurship and cities.

Started in New Orleans, Launch Pad has opened 3 new cities in 2018, all in Opportunity Zones, with plans for at least 20 by 2020. Launch Pad serves entrepreneurs as a coworking space, convening place, and community center, with a focus on ecosystem collaboration and support of local organizations. It can act as the gravitational point of an entrepreneurial ecosystem.

“Our strategy for growth in what we call 'momentum markets' is a reflection of the importance of entrepreneurship outside the typical startup hubs. Now more than ever great companies can be built anywhere,” said Anne Driscoll, President and co-founder of Launch Pad. ""The introduction of this legislation was the ultimate reinforcement of that plan, and a boost to the impact we can have in cities across the U.S.""

In New Orleans, Launch Pad has helped support hundreds of companies, which have created 5,000 jobs and raised $160 million in capital. Most impressively, from Launch Pad’s 22,000 square feet, its entrepreneurs have graduated to fill over 600,000 square feet of office space in the city. If you’re a mayor or economic development official looking to create jobs and fill space (and who among them isn’t?), it’s hard to think of a better way.

The entrepreneurial ecosystem in New Orleans is still emerging, despite many years of attention and appearance on “top startup hub” lists. In our recent Surge Cities analysis, New Orleans ranked 41st out of 50 overall, and was low on early-stage venture funding deals, low on high-growth company density, and in the middle of the pack on net business creation. The metro area did rank 7th overall in the rate of entrepreneurship, which indicates a strong pipeline of people trying to make it. This reinforces part of Launch Pad’s strength: in contrast to other types of entrepreneurship support organizations, it doesn’t restrict itself only to tech startups. It serves all comers, helping create a truly cohesive entrepreneurial community.

Launch Pad could be the best operating business example to deliver on the promise of the Opportunity Zone legislation.

This, too, is borne out in the data. In Startup Genome’s report on six early-stage U.S. ecosystems, done with the support of the Kauffman Foundation, we found reasons for optimism in New Orleans. On our measure of Local Connectedness, New Orleans scored higher than its peer cities and much higher than other comparable ecosystems globally. Entrepreneurs in New Orleans, we found, have high levels of Collisions (meaning they interact frequently with each other) and Relationships—the entrepreneurial network is dense. Most importantly, New Orleans topped the other cities on Sense of Community, our measure of the culture of giving and receiving help among entrepreneurs. Beneath the surface, Launch Pad has helped foster a strongly supportive community of entrepreneurs.

Launch Pad is not the only support organization for entrepreneurs in New Orleans: trepwise and Idea Village, among others, have been influential as well. But because of its location, its focus on community beyond just coworking, and its commitment to economic development, Launch Pad seems to stand out.

The Opportunity Zone potential is clear, especially since all four Launch Pad locations are in designated Opportunity Zones. In addition to New Orleans, the company has set up shop in Newark, Memphis, and Nashville. In the Surge Cities analysis, Memphis ranked 47th out of 50 overall and was low on all the entrepreneurship-related variables—the impact of Launch Pad, fueled by Opportunity Zone investment, could be transformational in the city. Launch Pad not only is one of the few emerging national Opportunity Zone businesses but also can house and support other businesses through its model.

It’s entirely possible that Opportunity Zones could renew distressed American communities through entrepreneurship. For that to happen, however, capital must be directed to those entrepreneurs. And for that to happen, an organization like Launch Pad needs to be at the center of any economic development strategy.",2019,02,06,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danestangler/2019/02/06/turning-opportunity-zones-into-real-opportunities-with-launch-pad/
bisnow,Whoops! 3 Opportunity Zone Mistakes People Have Made Already,"Interest in opportunity zones is as hot as ever, especially ahead of the IRS public hearing scheduled for Thursday morning. With everyone running headfirst into deals, it's good to be aware of how other people have messed up already — so that you don't have to.

Bisnow/Deirdra Funcheon

A February 2019 Bisnow panel about opportunity zones featured Greenberg & Traurig shareholder James Lang, Metro 1 CEO Tony Cho, Cherry Bekaert partner Carol Surowiec, PTM Partners CEO Michael Tillman, OPZ Bernstein principal Craig Bernstein, Vagabond Group CEO Avra Jain and moderator Clarence Williams, senior government relations consultant at Becker.

At Bisnow's Opportunity Zones 101 event in Miami last week, a lineup of panelists included Peebles Corp. CEO Don Peebles and Vagabond Group CEO Avra Jain. Panelists ran through expert tips on what to do (be a high net worth individual) and not do (make an iffy investment thinking that the zoning will magically save it) in regards to opportunity zones.

But ears especially pricked up when panelist Craig Bernstein, head of private equity firm OPZ Capital, mentioned that he has seen clients who have already messed up deals. Bernstein provided more details after the event.

""I have spoken with an investor who, within a single Opportunity Zone Fund, purchased an interest in a minor league sports team and an industrial warehouse building,"" Bernstein wrote in an email. ""The way the Opportunity Zone legislation is written, you currently need to sell your partnership interest in the fund. So basically if he wants to sell the sports team to an interested party, the buyer would also be forced to acquire the industrial warehouse. This is one of the primary challenges of having multi-asset funds.""

Bisnow/Deirdra Funcheon

Experts spoke at a Bisnow panel on opportunity zones in Miami: Affiliated Development CEO Jeff Burns, Pebb Capital co-founder Todd Rosenberg, Saul Ewing Arrnstein & Lehr partner Ronnie Fieldstone, Gilbane Development Chairman Robert Gilbane, and Weiss Serota Helfman Cole & Bierman member Joseph Hernandez.

Bernstein said he has seen a fair number of investors who have set up funds and self-certified them, rather than consulting with a qualified attorney or accountant. The way the state tax and organizational documents are filed, no steps — like specifically indicating that the new entity is a qualified opportunity zone fund — can be skipped.

One of the basic principles of the program — whether land falls in an opportunity zone — is subject to blunders. Each state determined which areas would be a zone, based on income levels and the desire for private investment in certain census tracts.

""I have seen numerous errors on the maps depending on which website you visit,"" Bernstein wrote. ""One individual I spoke with placed a property under contract under the guise that it was in an Opportunity Zone, to only find out after closing that there was an error on the map he initially reviewed. In fact, the property was not located within a designated Opportunity Zone. Before you acquire or invest in a property, check multiple sources, including the Treasury’s website, which specifically lists out the approved census tracts.""

Bisnow / Deirdra Funcheon

Peebles Corp. founder Don Peebles and Bilzin Sumberg associate Andrej Micovic

Other notable suggestions at the event included Greenberg & Traurig shareholder Jim Lang's suggestion to set up a ""sidecar vehicle"" in a joint-venture structure if mixing an opportunity zone fund with another funding source. Metro 1 CEO Tony Cho suggested deploying ""conscious capital"" and improving life for current residents in opportunity zone neighborhoods.

Peebles said to watch out for more instructions from the Treasury Department — he hoped rules will be expanded so that current landowners, not just new purchasers, will be allowed to benefit from the program — as well as legislative developments at the state level that could piggyback on or otherwise affect opportunity zones.",0,0,0,https://www.bisnow.com/south-florida/news/opportunity-zones/opportunity-zones-mistakes-97416
boston,Here’s what to know about the new Opportunity Zones program,"Sometimes opportunity knocks in an unexpected place, or at least that’s what the government hopes investors will see in its new Opportunity Zones program.

The program, which aims to spur development in underdeveloped or neglected areas, was created as part of the federal Tax Cuts and Job Acts in 2017.

But what does it mean to live in an opportunity zone, and how can a community take advantage of the new funding it may bring?

Here’s everything you need to know about the new program and what it means for the city.

What is an Opportunity Zone?

An opportunity zone is an underdeveloped or neglected area that could benefit from investment. Massachusetts’ selections are scattered throughout the state and, as shown on a map, encompass parts of communities.

Of the 138 federally approved areas in Massachusetts, 32 are within the 10 cities or towns with the lowest median family income in the state.

Forty-eight percent of the tracts are in “gateway cities,” which are municipalities with populations of 35,000 to 250,000, as well as median household incomes and education levels below the average in Massachusetts, according to the state. “Rural communities make up 18 percent of the communities with designated tracts.”

Boston has 13 Opportunity Zones, Quincy and Somerville each have two, and Cambridge has one.

Opportunity Zones and funding

“The statute provides federal tax benefits to investors who realize capital gains and invest them within Opportunity Zones through Opportunity Funds,” according to the state. These incentives accumulate.

There’s a temporary deferral — an investor can defer capital gains on income reinvested into Opportunity Funds. This gain must be recognized either when the investor pulls out of the fund or by Dec. 31, 2026, whichever comes first.

If an investor keeps his or her money in the Opportunity Fund for five years, the capital gains tax owed drops by 10 percent. If the investor stays in for seven years, this tax reduction becomes 15 percent.

If an investor keeps his or her money in the fund for 10 years, any gains are tax exempt.

How do Opportunity Zones tap into Opportunity Funds?

The key to getting funding in an Opportunity Zone is attracting an investor, according to the state. Communities should figure out how to do that and what types of investment from which they would benefit.

“In order to successfully attract Opportunity Fund investment, the Baker administration recommends that communities ensure that local permitting and zoning is conducive to the kinds of investments you aim to attract,” the state website says. “Additionally, your community may want to think about how to market the Opportunity Zone to private investors both within and beyond Massachusetts.”",2019,02,26,http://realestate.boston.com/new-developments/2019/02/26/opportunity-zones-program-explained/
forbes,3 New Hints Emerge On Final Opportunity Zone Rules,"Investors, community advocates and residents across America who have been anxiously awaiting economic revitalization through the Opportunity Zone program have reason to be more optimistic.

The government shutdown slowed the progress the IRS had been making toward determining final guidance on the new policy, but important hints are finally emerging on Capitol Hill that indicate the proposed legislation is headed for clarification.

The Opportunity Zone incentive program was written into the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to spur long-term economic investment in low-income communities. It has the potential to radically revitalize urban and rural districts across the country, build wealth in communities that need it most and save investors' money by reducing capital gains tax payments.

Vagueness about the rule’s proposed guidelines, first released in October 2018, created uncertainty and confusion. But with the first hints of spring finally arriving in the air, a warm glow has begun to illuminate the progress being made on Opportunity Zones.

Here are three recent developments from Washington that will have critical impact on the final guidelines for the program.

Congress sent a bipartisan letter to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin urging that Treasury give its attention to the OZ program and raising several key issues that Congress would like to see addressed with more specificity.

The purpose of the letter was to make clear for the Treasury what Congress members’ intent was when they sponsored the legislation in the first place, according to Mary Burke Baker, Government Affairs Counselor with K&L Gates, LP. The letter itself states that the tax incentive program “…is intended to deliver transformational impact, including new jobs and higher wages, in low-income areas throughout the country…”

“If Treasury was having a problem interpreting the proposed statute,” Baker says, “the letter should offer a certain level of comfort by way of explaining the Senators’ true intent, and that can be used to support the language in the original rule.”

With Congress fleshing out its intent here, Treasury has a clearer path toward knowing what it needs to do to move forward with final regulations. This “comfort letter,” as Baker calls it, “is of real importance because it is signed by all of the original authors of the Opportunity Zone legislation that remain in Congress.”

The IRS public hearing on OZ commentary Thursday, February 14, 2019, at 10 a.m.

As of December 28, 2018, the last date the public could submit comments on OZs, 145 individuals and community groups had done so, according to the Regulations.gov docket, and they covered a wide range of issues.

But when the government shut down in late December, the original public hearing that had been scheduled for January 10 before the IRS, where those comments and more from live witnesses would have been heard, was postponed, leaving investors and advocates in the dark.

Now that the government has reopened and the hearing has been rescheduled, public concerns will be formally reviewed and witness testimony taken into consideration. While the testimonies will be consistent with what has already been submitted to the IRS and Treasury, it will be the questions, answers and discussions during the hearing that could shed further light on officials' thinking for the next round of OZ regulations.

The IRS released instructions on how to implement OZ Form 8996, which is the form that a Qualified Opportunity Fund must use to certify that it is organized to invest in qualified Opportunity Zone property and whether it meets the requirement that at least 90% of the fund’s assets are invested in qualifying property.

“Other than a few grammatical changes,” Baker says, “the form itself has not changed from the draft released in October.” But, she adds, “This is our first glimpse at the details of how the IRS expects taxpayers to implement the form.”

While the instructions are likely to raise as many questions as they answer, says Baker, they do appear to address several of the key issues that are pending , signaling that IRS and Treasury officials are attempting to address critical items of the legislation that have slowed its adoption.

Investors will have to wait for the final ruling on what specific requirements need to be met in order to satisfy the so called 50% Test with regard to Qualified Opportunity Zone Businesses; the 30 Months Test, which establishes the timeframe in which substantial improvements must be made; what precise elements will be used to determine what constitutes Original Use (especially when abandoned, dilapidated properties are the subject of investment); and how community-centric reporting requirements that build accountability into the rule will be imposed.

With any luck, investors and community advocates will have these questions answered by the last frost of the season.",2019,02,11,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuapollard/2019/02/11/3-new-hints-emerge-on-final-opportunity-zone-rules/

bisnow,"Opportunity Zone Experts Voice Concerns Over Program's Rules, Suggest Fixes In IRS Hearing","Want to get a jump-start on upcoming deals? Meet the major players at one of our upcoming national events!

The opportunity zone program has created tremendous buzz throughout the real estate industry over the last year, but many investors have been waiting on the sidelines until there is a complete set of federal regulations before deploying money into underserved areas.

The Internal Revenue Service sought feedback in creating the regulations at a five-hour hearing Thursday, during which over two dozen stakeholders highlighted concerns they have with the rules of the program and suggestions for how they can be improved. More than 200 people attended the hearing at the IRS headquarters in D.C., and agency officials had to turn away some who were not testifying after the hearing room reached capacity.

Creative Investment Research's William Michael Cunningham testifying at the IRS Opportunity Zone hearing Feb. 14, 2019

The interest in the opportunity zone program from the investment community has only continued to grow, said Steve Glickman, who helped design the program while leading the Economic Innovation Group. Last year, he launched his own opportunity zone consulting firm. But Glickman told the IRS regulators that the lack of clarity around the rules is preventing investment from happening.

""Without more regulatory clarity the marketplace is somewhat frozen,"" Glickman said. ""I have talked to wealth managers around the country that control trillions of dollars of capital, much of which is interested in this program, but they have essentially not been willing to put it into the market yet because they're confused about the rules.""

Thursday's hearing focused on the first set of proposed opportunity zone regulations the IRS and Treasury Department released in October. It was originally scheduled for Jan. 10 but was delayed over a month because of the government shutdown. The administration plans to release a second set of regulations in the coming months and hold another public hearing before finalizing the rules for the program.

Created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the program offers tax advantages to investors who place capital gains into funds that invest in opportunity zones, a host of underserved areas local officials designated last year.

The investors, attorneys, accountants, advocates, local officials and other experts who testified at the hearing hope the IRS will heed their feedback in its formation of the final regulations. A handful of distinct themes emerged from the five hours of testimony.

Bisnow/Jon Banister

Rhode Island Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor and Delaware Prosperity Partnership CEO Kurt Foreman

One key point of concern centered around the six-month window the proposed regulations give for opportunity funds to hold capital before investing it into a qualified zone. Several stakeholders recommended this window be extended, including Delaware Prosperity Partnership CEO Kurt Foreman.

""Under the proposed rules, an opportunity fund has six months to deploy the capital it has raised before being subject to a potential penalty,"" Foreman said. ""Such a short time frame could be too demanding of a newly formed fund and could delay or discourage the formation of potential funds, an outcome we would like to avoid.""

A second issue that came up frequently was the lack of clarity around whether a fund could sell individual assets it invests in and reinvest the proceeds to deploy to additional opportunity zone projects without losing the tax benefits. Allowing asset sales will be critical for having diversified, multi-asset funds, Institute of Portfolio Alternatives Director Dan Cullen said, which is key to the success of the program.

""Having funds that are diversified and are multi-asset funds geographically will increase the public policy, intended by the statute and also increase the two parties we're trying to bring together, the capital — the wealth that's in our country — and the communities that have the need,"" Cullen said.

Several stakeholders also pushed the IRS to loosen the restrictions on funds investing in businesses located within opportunity zones. The law was crafted to include investment in companies and real estate, but the proposed IRS regulations make it difficult for funds to put money into businesses, multiple experts said.

Rhode Island Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor, who testified on behalf of a group of 12 state economic development executives, said this issue was his main reason for speaking at the hearing.

""We are primarily focused on ensuring that the rules allow for and incentivize investment in both real estate developments and operating businesses,"" Pryor told Bisnow after the hearing. ""In these zones, which are distressed census tracts, there is a great need for jobs and increased economic activity. To accomplish that, the investment in operating businesses is enormously important. As structured, the rules inhibit such investment.""

Economic Innovation Group Director of Impact Strategy Rachel Reilly, who joined the organization this month from Enterprise Community Partners, told Bisnow that fixing the rules to allow for investment could have significant impacts.

""A real estate-plus-business investment strategy could be particularly impactful, especially for incubators and coworking spaces looking to support talent in underserved communities,"" Reilly said.

Many experts also asked the IRS to provide more clarity on what types of development projects qualify as opportunity zone investments, and how substantially an existing building would have to be improved to receive the tax benefits for investors.

Glickman, speaking with Bisnow after the hearing, said he thought it was valuable for the IRS to hear from people involved with the opportunity zone program to understand areas of confusion they had that the agency may have overlooked.

""I think the IRS is getting increasingly aware through this hearing of how certain provisions I think they thought were very clear are being interpreted in different ways by the investor, fund manager and developer community,"" Glickman said.

Glickman expects the second round of regulations to be released next month, after which he expects some of the large investors who have been waiting for clarity before deploying capital to begin making moves.

""Once you have the full set of preliminary regulations, that will be clarity for many funds to launch and wealth managers to decide they have comfort to deploy real capital into the marketplace,"" Glickman said. ""By the end of this quarter, I think you'll see enough activity so that by the second half of this year you'll see much more capital move into these deals.""",0,0,0,https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/capital-markets/opportunity-zone-experts-voice-concerns-over-programs-rules-suggest-fixes-in-irs-hearing-97528

thehill,Opportunity Zones must work for working businesses,"In the first quarter of 2018, we and our colleagues worked with our governors to designate our states’ Opportunity Zones. No economic development program is perfect. But this new federal tax tool, which was introduced by over 100 bipartisan congressional co-sponsors, has great potential. We take our responsibility to utilize this new tool to strengthen the economic vitality of our communities and enhance the well-being of our citizens seriously. We selected zones based on the intent of Congress that this new federal capital gains tax incentive attract scarce equity capital to underinvested communities for two purposes: the development of brick and mortar projects and the growth of operating businesses. This program was not designed simply for investments in real estate. It was also created to foster entrepreneurial ventures, to strengthen manufacturers, to draw capital to businesses small and large, and to result in the production of jobs in these designated communities. As key stakeholders in the success of our states’ Opportunity Zones, we want to ensure that the regulations the IRS delivers in the coming weeks reflect this same two-part intent.

The scale of need is vast. As recently as 2016, more than three-quarters of all U.S. counties still contained fewer places of business than before the recession, according to the Economic Innovation Group. If current trends continue, some of the country’s most distressed census tracts may never recover the jobs they lost to the Great Recession. The status quo would have investors continue to pour capital into the places already doing well. Opportunity Zones have the potential to change investor behavior by providing an incentive to take off blinders and consider investing in spaces and businesses that can bring new vitality and opportunity to places that have been left behind.

We and our peers – a dozen top state economic development officials – have written two letters to Treasury, the IRS, and the regulatory authorities summarizing our suggestions to ensure this new tax incentive delivers what both Congress and our governors have promised their constituents. We make four main recommendations.

First, Opportunity Zone investors should be able to invest in high-impact operating businesses that can generate jobs and wealth at scale by drawing revenue from outside of the community into it. Investors should be able to inject equity into manufacturers and e-commerce companies in addition to the restaurants and storefronts that also make up a community. For example, this means that the 50 percent gross income requirement should be interpreted to require that qualifying entities be active businesses as opposed to holding companies or patent boxes. But it should not require that income be majority derived from a single point of sale in an Opportunity Zone, which would disqualify most e-commerce companies, manufacturers, and other businesses with the potential to create significant numbers of new jobs and wealth for their communities. (The current set of proposed regulations seemingly require such predominantly localized sales.) We agree with proposals that allow businesses the necessary operational flexibility to qualify for these investments, such as the straightforward requirements that 70 percent of a qualifying business’s tangible property be in an Opportunity Zone.

Second, the IRS and Treasury must demonstrate a basic understanding of what motivates investors to provide equity to operating businesses by writing rules and regulations that allow Opportunity Funds--the required vehicles for investment under this program--to create diverse investment portfolios. Successful Opportunity Fund managers will naturally seek to spread out their risk by investing in several businesses in case any of them fail. Diversification is particularly important in struggling communities where investors already view projects as riskier and returns are seen as less certain. Because sound funds will make multiple business investments, they will need flexibility in the time allowed to meet the law’s twice annual “90 percent asset test” to ensure that the Fund managers can put together a strong portfolio of qualifying business investments that will attract and keep investors interested in zone communities.

Third, Opportunity Funds should be able to buy and sell assets without triggering tax liabilities for their partners that would undermine the 10-year tax benefit. Specifically, the rules should allow funds to reinvest interim gains in a timely manner without incurring a penalty or triggering a taxable event. Successful investing requires a degree of nimbleness to react to new developments. Investors will be reluctant to commit to holding a stake in a single company for 10 years given all the forces that could intervene during that period. Investors should be able to divest from less-than-successful companies if they keep their capital at work in Opportunity Zones. The IRS could consider establishing a minimum hold period for any individual investment in a zone, but requiring an investor to hold each individual business investment for 10 years (rather than simply committing to remain invested in the Fund for 10 years) will significantly undermine the ability to invest in operating businesses.

Finally, we encourage Treasury to adopt simple, unobtrusive reporting requirements to collect data on Funds and their investments. Such reporting will illuminate where the incentive has been successful and will help identify areas for improvement and modification in the future. These data will help us understand whether this program is incentivizing the investments intended by Congress.

We recognize that finalizing new regulations is never as simple as it seems, but by working together, we are confident we can unleash the true potential of Opportunity Zones in these key communities.

azbigmedia,20 acres in Mesa Opportunity Zone sell for $2.25M,"You have been hearing and reading about the new capital gains tax incentives associated with the Opportunity Zones and investors and developers are taking interest quick. SVN Desert Commercial Advisors has several properties listed in the Opportunity Zone and recently sold 20 acres of the original 92 acres in Mesa, AZ across the Mesa-Gateway airport for a $2.25M.

The 20 acres are located on Ellsworth & Germann which is in a great location. With the expansion of ASU Poly Technic Campus and close proximity to the airport, there is a large amount of employment and new homes surrounding the site. SVN Advisors Director of Retail Leasing & Sales Investments, Rommie Mojahed and Senior Advisor Beau Flahart represented the seller, Ellsworth 92, LLC in the transaction. A spokesman for the buyer, Abington Emerson Investments, LLC referenced this property as a “home run site” for developing spec industrial.

Flahart stated, “The Opportunity-Zoned real estate is a massive “opportunity” for investors and developers. The buyer felt the location was in a perfect position to build in a thriving area with so much planned development ahead. “The groups that understand the incentives and take advantage of this are way ahead of the game,” said Flahart. The seasoned advisors have worked with the seller on a number of projects and work on a majority of their land holdings.

More importantly, SVN advisors still represent the seller in the remaining 72 acres at this same location off Ellsworth & Germann, which is only 1 mile south of Eastmark, the #1 best-selling master-planned community in the state of Arizona. Zoning allows for retail, office, and light industrial so developers will have plenty of opportunity to build.",2019,02,28,https://azbigmedia.com/20-acres-in-the-mesa-opportunity-zone-sell-for-2-25m/
therealdeal,Opportunity Zones,"The government's first public hearing on the popular tax incentive program drew concerns over refinancing those projects and for how long an Opportunity Zones asset can be held

Developers and investors are enamored enough with the federal Opportunity Zones program that they have been raising massive funds in hopes of taking advantage of the big tax incentive. But they remain cautious enough over of the program’s many unanswered questions that few have deployed much of the capital raised.

Those dueling realities played out Thursday in Washington, D.C., when the IRS’ first public hearing to solicit questions about the year-old program drew an overflow crowd. About 200 people gathered in a small room, and a couple of dozen speakers aired their concerns, according to three people who attended the hearing. The hearing had been scheduled for January, but was delayed because of the 35-day partial government shutdown.

Steve Glickman, a co-founder of Economic Innovation Group, was one of those in attendance. Glickman is credited with helping craft the Opportunity Zones program, which provides tax deferments and tax breaks for developers who invest in projects in designated low-income neighborhoods across the country. Also at the hearing were Michael Novogradac, a CPA and managing partner at Novogradac & Company; and Jill Homan, an Opportunity Zones adviser and fund manager.

One of the biggest questions asked, Glickman said, was about the amount of time that investment funds have to deploy capital raised for Opportunity Zones projects. Existing regulations give funds six months from the time the money is received. But many of the funds say they want to hold the cash for at least a year before deploying it.

Numerous Opportunity Zone funds targeting hundreds of millions of dollars have been launched in recent months, by firms including Youngwoo & Associates, Somera Road, Fundrise, RXR Realty and EJF Capital. Skybridge Capital is targeting a $1 billion fund. That fund was rolled out in December with EJF as a subadviser, though SkyBridge later dissolved their partnership and found a new subadviser.

In October, the government released its first set of guidelines, but left many topics unaddressed. It did specify that a business will qualify for the program if 70 percent of the company’s property is located within a designated zone.

The Opportunity Zones program pushed forward in President Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul plan gives investors and developers the ability to defer and potentially forgo paying some of their capital gains taxes if they hold the asset for at least five years. And the biggest gain comes after investors hold the asset for at least ten years. But real estate investors often buy and sell assets after only a few years.

Given that fact, could an investor sell an Opportunity Zone asset after three years, then reinvest the money into another Opportunity Zone project for seven years? Would the total 10-year hold period still qualify for the program?

Another question: How much capital can an investor or developer take out of a project when refinancing an Opportunity Zone property? And after the refinance, how will the proceeds of the refinancing be distributed to investors?

Asked, but not answered. IRS officials only listened. Investors and developers will be looking for those answers when the government release its second round of rules, which is expected in the next two months.",2019,02,15,https://therealdeal.com/miami/2019/02/15/so-many-opportunity-zones-so-many-questions-for-developers-investors/
globest,Many Opportunity Zones Are Already Gentrified,"Opportunity zones funds have quickly risen to the top of the investors bucket lists for 2019. However, the new investment vehicle, which promises to infuse capital into underdeveloped the communities in exchange for eschewing capital gains taxes, has also been controversial. Some experts have decried that opportunity zone investments wouldn’t work because they are markets where capital didn’t naturally flow. Well, as it turns out, many of the chosen opportunity zones have already seen a fair amount of capital infusion, and have already started or undergone gentrification.

A new report from RCLCO shows the top 100 gentrified opportunity zones. “Our analysis speaks to the different strategies real estate investors could pursue in opportunity zones,” Eric Willett, VP at RCLCO, tells GlobeSt.com. “Certainly, we expect to see significant amounts of capital pursue projects in areas that have gentrified rapidly over the last decade looking to capitalize on the momentum already present. However, we have also seen attractive opportunities in less gentrified communities for investments that are perhaps more community-oriented and designed in a way that can serve as a catalyst for other community investment.”",2019,02,14,https://www.globest.com/2019/02/14/many-opportunity-zones-are-already-gentrified/

hotelmanagement,"Opportunity zones: complex rules, major benefits","The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created a program that provides certain tax benefits related to designated census tracks, referred to as opportunity zones. These opportunity zones span the United States in low-income communities. These communities generally are ones with a 20 percent or greater poverty rate or median family income less than 80 percent of statewide median family income.

But just what do these zones mean for hotel investors—and just what is the opportunity?

“Anytime you have an opportunity zone, there is the possibility of generating tax savings and increased returns based on investments and projects in the opportunity zone, so this is important for hoteliers to be aware of,” said Joshua Ehrenfeld, partner of law firm Burr & Forman. He said that if a hotel developer or investor can find a project located in one of these opportunity zones, they can enjoy significant tax savings and potentially increase their returns on investment.

James Canup and David Lionberger, partners at law firm Hirschler, agreed. They said that investments in these zones through a qualified opportunity fund could provide a temporary deferral of capital gains and also the possibility of permanent exclusion of future appreciation on the investment in the QOF. They cited three major tax benefits in a QOF.

Related Story: What to know about opportunity zones created by recent tax reform

First, Canup said a taxpayer can defer capital gains from the sale of any nonqualified-opportunity-zone asset sold to an unrelated party. However, those gains need to be reinvested within 180 days of the date of the sale in a QOF prior to Dec. 31, 2026. The deferral of capital gain from the sale of the nonqualified-opportunity-zone asset will be triggered earlier than Dec. 31, 2026, if the investment in the QOF is disposed of before Dec. 31, 2026.

Second, Lionberger said if the investment in a QOF is held by the taxpayer for at least five years, the basis of the investment is increased by 10 percent of the original deferred capital gain. If the investment in the QOF is held by the taxpayer for at least seven years, the basis on the investment is increased by an additional 5 percent (for a total of 15 percent) of the original deferred capital gain. This means that if the investment is held for at least seven years, the taxpayer will only recognize 85 percent of the capital gain that was initially deferred until Dec. 31, 2026.

Third, Canup said if the investment in the QOF is held by the taxpayer for at least 10 years, the basis on the investment in the QOF is increased to the fair market value of the investment at the time it is either sold or exchanged. This means that there is no capital gain recognized on the sale of the investment in the QOF.

CBRE provided an example of how tax benefits from QOZs work: An investor buys stock for $1 million and later sells it for $11 million. The investor then puts that $10 million gain into an OZ investment. Taxes on that $10 million capital gain can then be deferred until 2026. If it is invested for at least five years at the end of 2026, the capital gains tax liability would only be for $9 million, a 10-percent step up in basis. If it is invested for seven years at the end of 2026, the capital gains tax liability is only for $8.5 million, an additional 5-percent step up or 15 percent total. If the OZ investment is then sold for $20 million, achieving another $10 million gain, the new gain would be tax-free if sold after a hold period of at least 10 years.

While the upsides look promising, sources said there are a few downsides. First, Lionberger said the rules surrounding investments in QOFs are complex. They also haven’t been fully fleshed out by the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service.

Ehrenfeld agreed that the rules offer a downside. “One qualification is holding rules, as you must be willing to follow up with a long-term holding,” he said. “These rules may not correspond to typical investment protocol including holding periods and expected returns. In a typical deal, you may be out in five years but in five years you might not be able to maximize on opportunity zones.”

Even so, hotel developers and investors are using the new tax law to their advantage. San Francisco-based JMA Ventures, a real estate investment and development firm, recently launched its second QOF to invest in ground-up development and renovation projects based in qualified opportunity zones in the western U.S. The fund is set to target multiple real estate types, including hospitality. When asked why the company decided to create a second QOF, CEO Todd Chapman said that the group is equipped to handle the complexity of the rules in order to benefit.

“The tax benefits of the opportunity zone program are only meaningful if the underlying asset is successful,” he said. “JMA’s experience vetting successful projects and leveraging various methods of data analytics to pinpoint and predict strong performing projects are important advantages of the fund.”

In recent years, JMA has managed the development of over $2 billion of real estate assets from concept and entitlement through completion and operation. The company developed the Sacramento Downtown Commons, which is located in an area that was later designated as a QOZ. The development includes the 250-room Kimpton Sawyer Hotel.

Look Before Leaping

Sources offered advice for hotel investors who are considering developing in a QOZ.

Ehrenfeld said that it’s first important to be precise and thorough about the financial model for the project.

“To take advantage of opportunity zones you have to be able to hit all the right characteristics, including the holding period, and if the model doesn’t reflect properly, the deal may be off,” he said.

Lionberger agreed, adding that the QOZ needs to make business sense apart from the tax benefits. “Investments in QOZs may pose challenges and certainly involve markets risks,” he said. “Investors should be confident that the investment makes sense from a business perspective.”

Ehrenfeld said that investors also need to compare the ROI for the QOZ to a typical ROI in a business model to understand where it might provide value or fall short. “Think of it as making an ‘apples to apples’ comparison,” he added.

He also said that research is key and investors need to be certain about the scope of a project. “You don’t want to enter a situation where the project creeps and suddenly does not qualify as an opportunity zone,” Ehrenfeld said.

Canup said taxpayers who want to take advantage of all three tax benefits should invest in a QOF this year in order to fully take advantage of the five- and seven-year holding requirements before the capital gain that is deferred on the sale of the non-QOZ asset must be recognized on Dec. 31, 2026.

Beyond that, all sources agreed that it’s best to seek advice of a qualified tax professional before investing in a QOF in order to forge ahead with full transparency—especially because the Treasury and IRS still need to provide more guidance.",0,0,0,https://www.hotelmanagement.net/legal/how-investors-can-benefit-from-qualified-opportunity-zones
washingtonpost,"Will ‘Opportunity Zones’ Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?","Buried in the Republican tax overhaul that President Donald Trump signed into law in late 2017 are incentives for investors who fund businesses or develop real estate in new “opportunity zones.” Banks, private equity firms, insurance companies and wealthy individuals are rushing to take advantage. Critics have raised questions about whether the tax breaks will spur development in places that really need it or just stimulate growth in communities that were destined to see investment anyway. Amazon’s planned new headquarters in New York City, for instance, will be located inside an opportunity zone, a fact that’s added to the controversy over the project.

1. What’s an opportunity zone?

It’s a U.S. census tract that meets the law’s criteria for high poverty or low incomes and has been nominated by its state for inclusion. More than 8,700 of all census tracts -- about a 10th -- have won designation as opportunity zones. They’re found in every state, in Washington, D.C. and in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. Some of the rural zones span giant swaths of land out West, while some urban zones are just a few square blocks.

2. Why so many?

Economic growth in the U.S. has been uneven. A handful of cities are booming, while much of the country -- from rural counties to aging Rust Belt towns -- get left behind. Giving investors an incentive to plow some of their $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains into these distressed communities could help jump-start growth, create jobs and lift incomes. Nearly all of the opportunity zones have poverty rates north of 20 percent or family incomes that are lower than 80 percent of the state or metro median.

3. What’s the problem?

There’s a debate over whether investors will pile into places that were already seeing development. An analysis by the Urban Institute found that most of the zones are in fact hurting -- fewer than 4 percent had experienced an influx of wealthier, college-educated people that would signal gentrification. But in Washington, D.C., about a third of the tracts have seen significant socioeconomic change. Critics also note that there’s no requirement that investments in opportunity zones benefit the community.

4. What about the Amazon site?

The New York City opportunity zone where Amazon plans a new headquarters-- with waterfront views of Manhattan -- is one of about 200 zones nationwide that are adjacent to low-income areas without being low-income themselves. The poverty rate for the Long Island City tract is less than 10 percent and the median household income is about $137,000, higher than any other opportunity zone in the state, according to the most recent census data. Faced with a barrage of criticism over the more than $2.5 billion in subsidies it was promised for the project, Amazon announced in January that it wouldn’t make use of opportunity zone tax breaks. But it could still benefit indirectly: A development partner could claim the tax break, then rent space to the retailer at a discounted price.

5. Whose idea is this?

It was hatched in a 2015 white paper by Jared Bernstein, who was an economic adviser to Joe Biden when he was vice president, and Kevin Hassett, who is now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for U.S. President Donald Trump. They wrote it for the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank co-founded by Sean Parker, the Napster creator and first president of Facebook Inc. A group of Republicans and Democrats introduced bills in the House and Senate to create opportunity zones in 2016, but the measures never reached a floor vote. One of the sponsors, Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, successfully pushed for a modified version that was tucked into the tax overhaul.

6. What are the tax breaks?

Essentially, the plan gives investors two different sweeteners: First, they can defer and reduce capital gains they’ve earned elsewhere by investing those proceeds in an opportunity zone. Second, they pay no capital gains on any opportunity-zone investment they hold for at least a decade.

7. Who decided where the zones are?

After the tax law passed, governors were given 90 days to nominate a quarter of the eligible zones in their state. Many tried to strike a balance between areas that were in greatest need and places that would be more likely to attract investments. The results included some surprising picks, including the arts district in Los Angeles. The U.S. Treasury Department then certified the selections.

8. Wasn’t this tried before?

Not exactly. There have been past efforts at spurring economic development in distressed areas, like the Empowerment Zones that were created during the 1990s. Many of these efforts fell short because of weak incentives and too much complexity. The backers of opportunity zones say the new incentives are simpler, more flexible and significant enough that investors will use them.

9. What will the zones cost?

When the bill was being considered, the Joint Committee on Taxation told Congress that the opportunity zone tax breaks would cost about $1.6 billion through 2027. But the figure would rise after that, as developers claim capital-gains exemptions on the sale of projects in opportunity zones held for more than a decade. Since the program is open-ended, the final tally will ultimately depend on how much money investors plow into opportunity zones and the gains that they realize.

chapelboro,The Chamber Corner: Chapel Hill’s ‘Opportunity Zone’,"By Katie Loovis, Vice President for External Affairs, The Greater Chapel Hill-Carrboro Chamber of Commerce

An area in Chapel Hill is now designated an “Opportunity Zone” and catching the eye of many investors.

This zone, the only one in Orange County, provides tax benefits to investors in order to spur economic development. Investor benefits range from deferring tax on prior gains to sheltering future gains for ten-year investments in the zone.

The word from Chapel Hill Town Economic Development Director, Dwight Bassett, who pursued this designation for the town, is that investors are already considering and purchasing properties and parcels in the zone.

The Opportunity Zone in Chapel Hill

The Opportunity Zone in Chapel Hill includes everything north of Franklin Street, east of MLK Boulevard and south of Estes Drive.

Basically, if you are at the corner of Franklin and Estes (near The Chamber) and drive up the Franklin Street hill towards UNC campus, everything on your right is in the zone (think Fast Med, Caffé Driade, and the entire block that includes Varsity Theatre).

From the corner of Franklin and N. Columbia Street (at Lula’s, formerly Spanky’s), turn right, drive downhill heading north on MLK Boulevard, and everything on your right is in the zone (think PNC Bank building, the open surface lot along Rosemary Street, the shopping center with Fly Leaf Books and Root Cellar at the Hillsborough Street intersection, and then the YMCA as you head up the hill towards Estes Drive).

Finally, turn right from MLK Boulevard onto Estes Drive and everything on your right as you make your way back to the intersection with Franklin at the Chamber is also in the zone.

Other Opportunity Zones

There are other Opportunity Zones in our region, including a huge swath across Chatham County(includes three census tracts – 203, 206 and 207.02 and the Moncure Megasite) and several areas in Durham County, the closest being in the southwest Durham (the area between Durham-Chapel Hill Boulevard, Garret Road, Old Chapel Hill Road, and MLK Jr. Boulevard).

National Framing

The Opportunity Zones Program is an economic development and tax incentive as part of the recent federal tax legislation known as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1).

Through the federal program, the state of North Carolina established 252 zones with at least one zone in every county. All certified zones “offer qualified investors certain tax benefits when they invest unrealized capital gains in these areas.”

Summary

The bottom line is that Opportunity Zones are low-income census tracts where tax incentives are designed to draw long-term investment to help revitalize urban, rural and distressed parts of the state. In exchange for the investment, investors receive a temporary capital gains deferral and other tax benefits.

Final details of this program are still being worked out, including the timeline for when funds need to be invested to realize the full benefit of the incentive, which could be by the end of 2019.

mainebiz,Real estate industry still waiting for final Opportunity Zone rules,"BANGOR — More than a year after the Opportunity Zone tax benefit was written into federal tax law, and five months after proposed rules were issued, investors, real estate agents and developers are still waiting for final rules from the U.S. Treasury.

While they wait, Opportunity Zone projects are slow to get off the ground and many details of how it works are still not clear, those who attended a Maine Real Estate and Development Association breakfast workshop on the topic were told.

Before those rules are finalized, there could also be some significant changes, Nelson Toner of Bernstein Shur and Andrew Smith of Baker Newman Noyes told the group.

The Feb. 14 hearing was originally scheduled for January, but delayed because of the federal shutdown, further dragging out the process.

""Not only do [the rules] have to be written, but they have to be reviewed,"" before they're final, Toner said. ""It may take another 30 to 60 days.""

""There are a few, not a lot"" of Opportunity Zone projects going forward in the state as the rule-making progresses, he said.

The tax benefit allows partnerships and corporations organized specifically to invest in a qualified Opportunity Zone to defer capital gains taxes on the money invested in the fund, as well as profits made on the property. It's designed to boost economic development in what is officially referred to as ""distressed areas,"" as well as create jobs.

Significant improvements must be made to either business property or a business itself in the zone to reap the tax benefit.

Capital gains invested in the fund may be temporarily deferred for up to nine years, with a 10% reduction in tax on the gain if the investor holds interest in the fund for five years. There is an additional 5% reduction in tax if the interest in the fund is held for seven years.

If it's held for at least 10 years, gains realized on the investment of the original deferred gains are excluded from tax. Any gains made in connection with the original investment are still taxed at this point, but less 15%.

There are 32 zones in Maine, and 8,761 nationwide. The U.S. Treasury estimates $100 billion will be invested in Opportunity Zones.

Some hurdles to jump

One ""major hurdle"" that was discussed at the Treasury hearing in February is that is that 90% of the LLC or partnership assets must be invested into an Opportunity Zone fund within six months to reap the tax benefits, Toner said.

Smith agreed that where development is involved, saying: ""Six months is way too short a time,""

Toner said that many stakeholders are advocating for a year, while some are pushing for 30 months.

""Hopefully we'll see that at least extended to a year,"" he said.

Another concern is whether land bought before Jan. 1, 2018, when the lax law went into effect can be developed in a zone and get the tax benefit. ""That would have particular impact here in Maine,"" Toner said.

There are other questions surrounding the makeup of partnerships and nuts and bold of the investing process.

Unclear business development language

Toner said most Opportunity Zone projects will likely be property development, but improvement of a business is also part of the law and language is still not clear regarding how that would work.

Language about businesses that are invested in, for example, says that ""substantially all"" of the business's property must be in the Opportunity Zone — but that phrase and other language is not specific enough to help businesses determine if they're a good fit.

He said when a business is brand new, ""How do they know they're going to qualify [within the time frame]?""

He said one possibility would be to change the rules so that if a business knew within the time frame that it would ultimately qualify in the future, it would not be penalized.

""How do you do due diligence? That's one of the struggles,"" he said.

The law also says that at least 50% of gross income of the business must be ""derived from an active trade or business.""

""What does that mean?"" Toner said.

He said there are concerns about having operating capital if the rules are that rigid..

""[A business] has to have cash available, has to be able to do things,"" he said.

He said there's uncertainty ""about where these rules are going.""

Some things are clear

Some of the rules established in October, however, are clear and make the program accessible.

One big one is that it's self-certifying — the LLC or partners need only to indicate that's what they are on their tax return.

Also straightforward is the language about property improvement once the fund invests in the zone.

The statute requires that property in the zone, after being acquired by an Opportunity Zone fund, be either new or ""substantially improved,"" within 30 months.

""Substantially improved"" means that investment on developing the property once it's bought must equal what was spent on it ""and a dollar more,"" Smith said.

Smith used the example that a partnership invests $1 million in a zone, $400,000 into a a building and $600,000 into land. If $400,001 in improvements is spent on the building in 30 months, that is adequate.

Unlike other programs, no certificate of occupancy, or other measure of completion is required.

""It's unique,"" Toner said. ""It's about spending.""

He said, overall, the program is an investment vehicle that can be ""tremendous"" once the rules are clear.",2019,02,27,http://www.mainebiz.biz/article/20190227/NEWS01/190229958/real-estate-industry-still-waiting-for-final-opportunity-zone-rules
theaggie,"Davis receives opportunity zone designation to spur investment, development","Mixed expectations for how new federal program will affect Davis

On Feb. 5, the City of Davis announced that a Davis region has been chosen to receive opportunity zone status. Opportunity zones were created within the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to address national economic disparities by using tax benefits to incentivize distressed area investment.

Davis’ opportunity zone, defined by census tract, is approximately 0.8 square miles in size. It is “bordered by the north/south UPRR line on the west, L St. and Pole Line Rd. on the east, Covell Blvd. and 5th Street on the north and I-80 to the south,” according to the press release. Current development projects already in this tract include the controversial Nishi Student Housing project, Lincoln 40 Apartments, 111 Richards Hotel and Trackside Center.

Whether or not the opportunity zone will affect current development projects will depend on the timelines of the projects and the regulations that will continue to be released by the Internal Revenue Service.

So far, guidelines for how opportunity zone tax benefits will work are simpler and more flexible than previous similar place-based development projects, such as the New Market Tax Credit program and the Enterprise Zone program.

The opportunity zone model incentivizes long-term investment. If someone invests their profit from a sale or an investment — their capital gains — into affordable housing, real estate or infrastructure in an opportunity zone for five years, their capital gains tax will be reduced by 10 percent.

For instance, if the capital gains tax is normally 50 percent, an investment of $1 million in an opportunity zone would mean that after five years, the investor would have to pay only 40 percent — $400,000, instead of $500,000. For seven and 10 years, investors receive even more incentive — a 15 percent tax reduction — and for a 10-year investment, they also do not have to pay capital gains tax on earnings that came from investment in the zone.

John Whitcombe, a Nishi Gateway Student Housing partner, believes this Davis opportunity zone may benefit the Nishi project.

“Front end capital in the millions of dollars will be required,” Whitcombe said via email. “The opportunity zone may be a solution to incentivize front end investor participation.”

While Mayor Brett Lee agrees that the zone will produce benefits, he believes that lot sizes of the zone may prevent these benefits from being significant.

“There aren’t a lot of large parcels in that area,” Lee said. “You can imagine that if there were 50-acre parcels available, the amount of income on that parcel could be quite substantial — so that the savings by deferring taxes could be quite substantial — but for smaller parcels, I’m not sure how big of an impact [the opportunity zone] would have.”

On the other hand, a potential exists for the opportunity zone to be too effective. One CityLab article warns that poorly chosen opportunity zones “could pour gasoline on a market that’s already white hot,” leading to gentrification and displacement for the very communities the program aims to serve.

Thus, when areas are already developing without the help of opportunity zone incentives, as Davis’ zone seems to be, there are some risks of overly rapid development. This would only be a danger, of course, if Davis’ opportunity zone is effective, despite its small parcels.

Another reason for judicious selection of opportunity zones is because they are in limited supply. An area gains eligibility to become an opportunity zone if it meets a definition of a Low-Income Community, but only 25 percent of census tracts can be chosen from those eligible, a decision ultimately made by state governors.

Noli Brazil, a UC Davis assistant professor in community and regional development, spoke about how it is important for these place-based programs to take into account regional change over time for this reason.

“[The criteria] might capture a disadvantaged neighborhood, but for the past five years, it’s improving because of some kind of renewal process, gentrification —and so that kind of neighborhood — is that the type of target that these development programs need to be going after?” Brazil said. “Instead, [the program should be] focusing more on neighborhoods that have continued to experience decline, or are increasing in decline.”

Brazil also warned about place-based programs in general, particularly because of their history of causing displacement.

“I think the broad theory or the idea of place-based programs are fine, but I think it needs to be combined with other approaches,” Brazil said. “I think it needs to bring a more holistic approach to development.”

Sarah Worley, the business engagement manager for the City of Davis, was more confident than Brazil about the promise of opportunity zones and similar tax incentive program to support local business growth.

“It’s definitely a tremendous opportunity, and it can be combined with other tax increment programs, etcetera,” Worley said. “Actually, the State of California is proposing to do that very thing — to say this is just one tool in the toolbox that can help direct investment in areas that would really benefit from it.”

Worley said that she has received a few inquiries about the zone and that the City of Davis has been proactive in doing outreach to raise awareness about the zone, but that investor interest is tempered by the lack of information from the federal level so far.

“It’s still very new, and people are waiting to find out, well, okay, how is this really going to work?” Worley said.

The State of California has published online tools to help interested investors engage with opportunity zones, including an online portal with more information and a marketplace to review and post investment projects. The IRS had been planning to release more regulations Feb. 14, but has been delayed by the government shutdown.

thespectrum,Opportunity Zones — “opportunity” for whom?,"Buy Photo Lisa Rutherford (Photo: The Spectrum & Daily News)

OZs were created when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act) was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in December 2017. The Act specifically states: “(Sec. 13823) This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones.” Utah’s Senator Hatch co-sponsored the Act.

On the face of it this sounds good, right? Help areas that need help. Governor Herbert worked with county and local leaders to identify OZs in Washington County, based on existing census tracts. This resulted in Washington County getting two OZs. The largest OZ includes Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and Red Cliffs Desert Reserve, much public land along Highway 18 and the Shivwitz Reservation. The second and smallest zone is south of St. George Boulevard and includes Dixie State University.

Even given the census-tract qualification, these two areas seem very odd to me – the one because it includes “protected” public lands with, understandably, no population and the other in a well-populated area of St. George. According to IRS information the two zones are listed as “low-income community” areas. That may apply to the public lands, Shivwitz reservation and areas along Hwy 18, perhaps with exception of Dammeron Valley, but the DSU area seems questionable.

According to the IRS, OZs were established to help provide tax breaks for investors while directing taxable capital gains money to economically-distressed areas. I do not see the DSU area as economically-distressed. In fact, DSU is the fastest-growing university in Utah. It turns out DSU’s “Innovation Plaza” is the focus of this effort to direct money to the area.

Now, I am not against Innovation Plaza which is going great guns according to a July 2018 St. George News article: “The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration announced June 21 that it had awarded $876,000 to Dixie State’s Innovation Plaza project so it can purchase equipment and support networking activities for the facility’s launch.” I am against using a tax-break feature of the 2017 tax reform Act to gain access to money that according to the Act’s language is meant to support those in real need. In all fairness, Innovation Plaza’s goal is to create better jobs for our area. However, it remains to be seen if that will occur. This county, even with all the growth seen over the past twenty years, has not seen much improvement in wages even as housing prices increase. I’m not the only one concerned about the OZ idea. Economist Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and author of “The Reconnection Agenda: Reuniting Growth and Prosperity” was an early contributor to this idea due to the scarcity of capital in places with great need and inability of low-income people to “move to a better place.” Although he suggests we give OZs a chance, he advises their progress should be scrutinized and Treasury dictate strong reporting requirements. His biggest concern – and perhaps the biggest hope of investors! – is that Treasury fails to collect adequate data to evaluate relevant outcomes, resulting in just another method of sheltering capital gains. That would be another loss for those truly in need and another feather in the cap of those who support the rich over the needs of the poor.

Perhaps Utah leaders should be asked to explain their rationale for identifying these areas.

bisnow,A Few 'Brave Souls' Will Likely Be Opportunity Zone Guinea Pigs As The Market Waits,"Want to get a jump-start on upcoming deals? Meet the major Boston players at one of our upcoming events!

Massachusetts developers are still cautious in tackling opportunity zones, and successful deals may hinge on a few brave guiding lights who jump first — preferably in time to reap the program’s full tax rewards.

The Charlestown Navy Yard is one of several desirable opportunity zones in Greater Boston.

""The brave souls who want to do the first few deals and endure the brain damage associated with that will be the pioneers, but a lot will be sorted out from that,” MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning senior lecturer Karl Seidman said. “Then you have a model that can be replicated.""

Developers and investors have examined how to pursue deals in Massachusetts' 138 opportunity zones for months, but not all opportunity zones are created equally.

Traditionally low-income areas of Fall River and New Bedford are both included, but so are development hot spots like the Alewife submarket in Cambridge, the Charlestown Navy Yard and areas of Somerville surrounding Assembly Row.

The IRS released opportunity zone regulations in October, and Massachusetts developers and investment groups say there is now more clarity to the program. However, they are also split between a wait-and-see approach and cautiously moving toward closing a deal for a variety of reasons.

WinnCompanies CEO Gilbert Winn's firm is working on five Massachusetts opportunity zone projects and looks to close on those in the next 12 months. Winn doesn't think developers are taking time due to any difficulty in navigating opportunity zones; he thinks it is just a matter of finding the right kind of project to pencil out.

""It may take a little longer than expected because good, underwrite-able projects are few and far between on their own, and it takes time to locate additional ones,"" Winn said.

Cambridge's Alewife submarket, already a burgeoning life science cluster, is an opportunity zone.

MassDevelopment, a quasi-public economic development agency, says it is already seeing developers move forward with projects that are raising equity from opportunity zone investors. It also recognizes that it may take time for investors and advisers to gain expertise in navigating the IRS requirements.

That doesn’t mean developers are idly sitting by. The sooner a project moves forward, the more it can benefit from capital gains tax deferment or even exemption.

“There has been a noticeable spike in opportunity zone transactions than non-opportunity zone transactions,” said RSM partner and real estate analyst Troy Merkel, who is speaking with Seidman, Winn and others at Bisnow’s Boston Opportunity Zones Summit March 13. “Land is transacting, and people are getting their ducks in [a] row. They need to deploy capital fast, so they need to have an investment parcel ready to meet the needs of investors.”

Merkel expects several waves of opportunity zone development, and the first will most likely be shovel-ready projects in areas like the Navy Yard, Alewife, South Boston and Somerville. Not only will these initial developers be primed to reap the program’s full, 10-year-hold tax benefits, they will also be able to snap up land in some of the most desirable areas in Greater Boston.

All four zones are close to research universities and have begun to market themselves as potential lab and innovation clusters to complement Kendall Square in East Cambridge.

While that might be good news for developers in Greater Boston, a new lab a mile or two away from MIT doesn’t exactly scream “underserved neighborhood transformation” like the program was intended. Creating that kind of change and encouraging developers to go into less desirable areas will take state-level development tool pairings and local encouragement.

There are opportunities for “twinning” opportunity zone projects with other development tools at the state and federal level, according to Quaker Lane Capital Managing Principal Carlos Febres-Mazzei.

Developers and investors expect state and local tax credits to bring more interest to opportunity zones in places like Fall River, Mass.

Other investment groups point to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and historic tax credits as ways to make less desirable opportunity zones more appealing to developers. Those tools are vital in opportunity zones where multifamily projects are the best fit.

Multifamily developments have accounted for 65% of all opportunity zone transactions in Massachusetts since the beginning of 2018, according to Reonomy data. Multifamily transactions were nearly 67% of all Fall River transactions in the same time frame. The figure was nearly 73% in New Bedford.

But state-level credits aren’t enough. Massachusetts cities and towns are known for their high barriers to entry, particularly in the planning and approval process. That is a timing headwind for a tax break set to expire in 2026. Speeding up the approval process may be the best card secondary and tertiary opportunity zones have to play in landing more opportunity.

“If you really want a Fall River or a New Bedford to attract developers, these municipalities need to look to streamline the approvals process and work with the developers,” Merkel said. “This is a time crunch, and it’s probably the No. 1 thing I hear when I talk to developers.”

governing,Amazon HQ2 Was an 'Unfortunate Distraction' From 'Needy Communities',"Amazon's announcement last week that it would no longer build a corporate headquarters out of New York City was met with harsh criticism from many state and local leaders. Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the online retail company, while Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, lambasted the progressive politicians whose attacks against Amazon ultimately killed the deal.

""Amazon chose to come to New York because we are the capital of the world and the best place to do business. However, a small group [of] politicians put their own narrow political interests above their community,"" Cuomo said in a statement shortly after Amazon's announcement.

But for backers of so-called opportunity zones, Amazon's withdrawal removes an unwelcome distraction from a burgeoning effort to attract new investment to low-income neighborhoods.

Opportunity zones were created as part of the 2017 federal tax overhaul. If private investors plop money into these economically distressed neighborhoods, they can shield portions of their capital gains tax liability. There are 8,700 of these zones scattered across the country. One of them is in Long Island City, Queens, in New York, where Amazon was going to locate one of its two new headquarters.

When Amazon made its HQ2 announcement in November, many people questioned the area's opportunity zone participation. If the neighborhood was attractive enough for the tech giant, then why did it need help from a federal investment program for distressed areas?

“When you first heard about the opportunity zone program, you said, 'Well this is helpful to poor people,'"" says Timothy Weaver, an urban policy professor at the State University of New York at Albany. ""But then you hear Amazon’s name and that doesn’t seem like something to help the poor.""

On the same day Amazon announced its plans to move to Long Island City, Goldman Sachs announced that its opportunity zone fund was investing $83 million into the same neighborhood. The pairing of the two announcements, which Goldman Sachs said was a coincidence, led to sharp criticism of the opportunity zone program from the press.

Unlike Goldman Sachs, Amazon is too large to have qualified for an opportunity zone tax break. But the company nonetheless would have benefited from it being an opportunity zone, say Weaver and others. For instance, Goldmans Sachs had already planned to finance construction of apartments in Long Island City.

Now, with the Amazon move off the table, Weaver suggests the opportunity zone plan, at least in Long Island City, can move forward on its merits.

“I certainly think the HQ2 saga has been an unfortunate distraction at the expense of the thousands of needy communities nationwide that stand to benefit from thoughtful opportunity zone implementation,” says John Lettieri, the president and chief executive officer of the Economic Innovation Group, the think tank that helped draft the opportunity zone language in the 2017 tax plan. That group, started by Napster founder and former Facebook executive Sean Parker, has spent more than five years trying to draw investment to economically depressed areas.

“There are outliers, but the national numbers aren't ambiguous: The vast majority of opportunity zones are facing an array of deep socioeconomic challenges,"" Lettieri says. ""They deserve far more serious attention than they are getting.""

Neither Lettieri or Weaver will speculate on whether Amazon's exit will have an impact on investment in the Long Island City opportunity zone. The program is still new. The rules governing opportunity zones are still subject to change, and the market conditions are always in flux, Lettieri says.

And questions remain as to whether the program will deliver jobs or services as intended. Weaver has long been a critic of opportunity zones. His belief is that a tax incentive program like this one naturally will encourage those investments designed to deliver maximum returns. That means high-yield projects like real estate developments, but not other projects that could perhaps better serve distressed communities.

“The type of things we might want in these neighborhoods -- schools, libraries or playgrounds -- have nothing to do with investment and profit,” Weaver says.",0,0,0,http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-amazon-hq2-new-york-opportunity-zones.html

A rendering of Hines' The Preston in Downtown Houston

Hines' new residential tower, The Preston, will be funded by a Qualified Opportunity Zone fund. The firm formed a joint venture with the Cresset-Diversified QOZ Fund.

The Preston, a 373-unit luxury tower in Downtown Houston, is scheduled to start construction in March. It will be the tallest residential development in Downtown Houston when it is completed in 2020.

This is the first project the fund is pursuing and is in one of the fastest-growing urban areas, Cresset co-founder Avy Stein said in a release.

“Adding in the tax benefits of the Qualified Opportunity Zone, we became even more excited about this property. We believe it is an excellent first investment for the Fund,” he said.

Houston has designated 150 areas as opportunity zones, from Downtown to distant suburbs like Richmond and several neighborhoods in between.

“QOZs represent a powerful intersection of public policy and investment opportunity, and we are excited for the potential of creating significant impact for the Houston community,” Cresset co-founder Eric Becker said in a release. “Together with Hines, we have built an experienced, multi-disciplinary team to source and execute great opportunities like The Preston, which are in the path of progress.”

This is the 10th project nationally between Diversified Real Estate Capital and Hines.

“We have a long-term relationship with Hines and look forward to pursuing many more QOZ opportunities together,” Diversified Real Estate Capital founder Larry Levy said in a release. ""Partnering with Hines on The Preston is a great example of our Fund investment model: working with top-rated developers in the United States on high-quality projects in prime locations in major markets.”

Densifying Downtown through residential expansion has been a paramount goal of the city, which in the past provided tax breaks to residential developers.

The number of Downtown residents has increased to more than 9,000 this year compared to 3,800 residents in 2013, according to Central Houston. The goal is to top more than 30,000 residents over the next 20 years.

The Preston represents the first of many projects that the Cresset-Diversified QOZ Fund will pursue, according to the release. The federal opportunity zone program was passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created to spur development in economically depressed areas.

To encourage capital investment in these areas, the program provides tax breaks for investors who make long-term investments that have the potential to promote economic growth in the zones.

Hines couldn't be reached for additional comment.

deseretnews,In our opinion: Opportunity zone investment is a solid policy approach for Utah,"Discussions about addressing wealth inequality typically lead to costly, government-heavy solutions. A market-based proposal, however, is already in place and gaining momentum.

It involves investment by large money interests in so-called “opportunity zones” designated by state and local governments, often in partnership with private philanthropic organizations. Such investment has been made attractive by a component of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that offers sizeable tax breaks to those who invest in troubled communities in ways that might end up improving infrastructure, creating jobs or increasing the availability of affordable housing.

So far, there are 8,100 designated opportunity zones, including 46 in Utah. On the investment side, at least 80 “opportunity funds” have been created while fund organizers have reportedly raised nearly $20 billion. There is an altruistic component, but the investments are also potentially very lucrative for those with large amounts of investible assets. The tax plan allows those who invest in such funds to exempt up to 15 percent of the original capital gain from the funds invested, depending on how long they maintain their involvement. In addition, no taxes would be owed on gains in the value of the investment.

The plan has sparked widespread interest in hedge fund circles, potentially leading to a healthy pipeline of investment from Wall Street to Main Street. A recent conference in Salt Lake City on the growing interest in opportunity investment was profiled in an article in The New York Times.

The “opportunity investment” approach to combating poverty does indeed involve taxpayer subsidy, but it comes in the form of tax breaks as opposed to continuously funneling money for social programs. It's a welcome contrast from the idea of “new socialism,” involving a government-led assault on social and environmental problems, not unlike what the country saw during the New Deal in the 1930s, and the War on Poverty decades later.

Both eras witnessed a surge of social programs dependent upon large government involvement, including the construction of sprawling housing projects in urban areas. In the current context, there is a compelling argument to incentivize the private sector to grab a stake in the fight against things like intergenerational poverty, rather than levying higher taxes on the wealthy to finance what would inevitably become a bureaucratic front in that battle.

As a real-world example, a chronic shortage of affordable housing along the Wasatch Front is leading cities and counties to offer various subsides for residential development. If private investors were to swoop into the seven “opportunity zones” outlined by Salt Lake City’s economic development office, the need for those subsidies would, in a word, subside. Tax money would still be involved, but market-based influences would determine the nature of development in a way that would be arguably more efficient and responsive to long-term needs.

Society is better off when both the public and private sector find unique solutions to difficult problems. Opportunity zones provide a way to tap private money to help a community.",2019,02,23,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900057044/in-our-opinion-opportunity-zone-investment-is-a-solid-policy-approach-for-utah.html
upenn,Why ‘Opportunity Zones’ Could Lift Up America’s Struggling Towns,"The $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, was the subject of heated debate about who mainly benefited from the tax overhaul. But buried in the plan was a provision that The New York Times called “the first new substantial federal attempt to aid [struggling] communities in more than a decade.”

The Tax Act created so-called “opportunity zones” meant to stimulate investment in low-income communities. Each state would designate what areas these zones would include. Venture capitalists and real estate developers who place at least 90% of their investment into an opportunity zone can see lower or even no taxes on capital gains depending on how long they stay.

More than 8,700 areas across the nation have been designated as opportunity zones, according to Forbes, and estimates put the number of residents impacted at 35 million. But will this provision truly revive the deep malaise in some of these towns?

“It all sounds great, but of course the devil is in the details,” said John Hollway, associate dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, speaking at the recent conference “Opportunity Zones and Inclusive Community Development.”

Could the incentive be a win-win for both investors and neighborhoods? Will the zones function as they are meant to on paper — helping struggling communities — or will they merely be a windfall for the wealthy? What will be the impact on longtime residents, small businesses and the quality of life?

Among those interested in the answers is John Legend, who was instrumental in organizing the conference and also served as moderator. Although most people know him as an award-winning singer-songwriter, he is also an activist for community development, education and criminal justice. Legend said that while he is “blessed and fortunate” to be able to make music for a living, being in his position also enables him to convene discussions on important topics and to help “impact people’s lives who are often overlooked and not heard.”

“You can’t be a not-in-my-backyard progressive where you want racial equality, but you don’t want those kids in school with your kids.” –John Legend

Legend grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Springfield, Ohio. “A lot of my city is an opportunity zone as defined by the guidelines of the new legislation,” he said. “I’m very familiar with what it’s like to live in one of these areas.”

Joining Legend at the Opportunity Zones conference were public policy experts, community development representatives and academics alongside real estate developers and investors.

Promise and Peril of Opportunity Zones

“In today’s economy, you’ve got a record number of people in places getting left behind,” said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization. He said that often top-line national statistics don’t reflect local realities.

Lettieri termed America’s economic growth “geographically fragmented … on a scale we’ve never seen before.” He asserted that post-Great Recession, the most prosperous 20% of ZIP codes are generating more net new jobs, businesses, population growth and advanced degree holders than the remaining 80% of ZIP codes combined, “by a long shot.”

What those other 80% of ZIP codes lack, said Lettieri, is access to long-term equity capital. At the same time, many American businesspeople have done very well post-recession. There has been much wealth accumulation, which could be used for “very powerful purposes,” he said.

Louis Dubin, a partner at the D.C.-based real estate developer Redbrick LMD, commented, “I’ve never seen — my career — so much capital looking for a home.” Lettieri added that many investors are seeking guidance for where to place their assets because “they don’t know how, they don’t know where, and they don’t want to do it alone.” The opportunity zones incentive could lead them to “scale in places that desperately need it.”

As for any potential risks for developers when investing in low-income communities, could legislation like opportunity zones be enough of a game-changer to make it worthwhile? Dubin noted that the cost of capital has plunged from double-digits to “probably in the single digits.” This means that real estate projects that were “marginally doable” have become doable.

However, additional regulations and legal guidance around opportunity zones are still being issued by the IRS. Dubin said he was looking to the first quarter of 2019, when “we’ll start to get a lot more clarity on how this is all going to work, and some of the early best practices around the issue.” He added, “It’s a very exciting time in our business, but we’re being cautious.”

Margaret Anadu, managing director of the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, said the firm invests $1 billion annually of equity capital in underserved communities and has been doing so for nearly 20 years. She emphasized the effort and care needed to invest productively. “One of the things we’ve learned — and that’s with Philly, Camden, Baltimore, or wherever we are — is that it’s really hard, and it takes a lot of time, intention and real engagement with stakeholders.”

Goldman provides the capital and relies on information from partnerships with community development organizations, not-for-profits and sponsors ‘on the ground.’ “We don’t spend a dollar until we have spent time with [those organizations,] understanding what the needs are,” Anadu said.

“One of the things we’ve learned … is that it’s really hard, and it takes a lot of time, intention and real engagement with stakeholders.” –Margaret Anadu

And the answer isn’t always straightforward. Sometimes community leaders will disagree about what constitutes progress, she said. Indeed, community engagement must be a front-end process. “Don’t just swoop in and ‘save’ them” with a fully-fledged plan, said one attendee.

One community development organization with which Goldman works is Enterprise Community Partners, a Maryland-based national nonprofit that provides affordable housing across the U.S. Anadu said she appreciated working with knowledgeable entities like Enterprise because the deals in question are typically “incredibly complicated.”

“[Opportunity zones] are one incentive that will push us forward, and will move some of those marginal deals into the ‘go’ column. But it still needs this tax incentive, that tax credit, this local abatement, etc.,” Anadu said. Her group looks for partners who in addition to understanding the “human side and the need side,” know how to get a deal done.

Enterprise’s former CEO, Terri Ludwig, agreed. It’s important to “lift up the local community voice and understand what are the needs, what are the processes, and how can we actually bring something to bear — whether that’s affordable housing, a charter school, a healthcare clinic, or something around job creation.” It really takes a blend of activities to make a difference, Anadu added.

Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, now a Columbia University professor of urban and public affairs, agreed that opportunity zones should be viewed as “one tool of many.” Realistically, any deal that gets done is usually “a half of this, a half of other sources,” he said.

The idea that opportunity zones should be combined with other initiatives to be truly effective — with programs to improve education, employment, medical care, nutrition and criminal justice — was a recurrent theme at the conference. Some said designating such zones is merely a tax incentive, not a program to help distressed communities.

Local governments and community advocates need to be thoughtful and vigilant about how it’s implemented. “The legislation is so broadly written that savvy investors, corporations and real estate developers could exploit it,” according to a Bloomberg article.

Protecting Existing Residents and Businesses

Nutter called for “intentionality” by public officials. “The government should not put itself in a position where it’s a passive actor and just kind of let the wild, wild West happen … and you’re just excited that somebody wants to invest. You have to make some tough decisions,” he said. A mayor should be asking, for example, “Where’s our best impact? What’s it going to do about poverty, about public safety? What’s going on with the schools in that particular neighborhood?”

“The government should not put itself in a position where it’s a passive actor and just kind of let the wild, wild West happen … and you’re just excited that somebody wants to invest.” –Michael Nutter

Nutter also talked about the challenges of revitalizing neighborhoods while not driving property taxes so high that existing residents face eviction. “Not only [should we be] talking about incentives to invest, but also incentives for the ability to stay, and that you don’t end up like my grandmother who used to talk about [being]… house-rich and cash-poor.”

Nutter said when he was Philadelphia’s mayor, he implemented the city’s first-ever homestead exemption — the Longtime Owner Occupants Program — which provided a tax abatement for homeowners whose property assessment tripled or more from year to year, so their taxes would stay affordable.

Other initiatives were discussed: empowerment zones, enterprise zones, renewal communities, down payment assistance, lease-to-own programs for small businesses. It was clear that there was no single formula for success. The point was also made that better metrics are needed: not just dollars funneled into a community, but whether the situation of longtime residents and businesses had changed for the better.

Several panelists commented that historical, systemic racism is partly to blame for the intractable problems of many distressed communities. It was important to acknowledge that, they said. “You cannot overstate how our whole housing financing policy was built around intentional structural racism,” said Ludwig. “How can we be just as intentional about ‘un-designing’ that?”

Anadu ageed. “These communities didn’t become underserved overnight. There were reasons: intentional, legal, historical, racism,” she said. “So, we also don’t think the challenges in these neighborhoods will get solved overnight.”

Legend also noted that “a lot of times folks don’t want to live in the same neighborhood as those people. … You can’t be a not-in-my-backyard progressive where you want racial equality, but you don’t want those kids in school with your kids.” He added, “We all have a responsibility as individuals to not be part of the problem.”",0,0,0,http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/can-opportunity-zones-lift-americas-struggling-towns/
cpexecutive,Opportunity Zones Program Takes a Step Forward,"Edward Renn, Partner, Withers Worldwide

Last week, the IRS held a public hearing in Washington, D.C., on proposed regulations concerning investments in qualified opportunity funds (QOFs). Though much remains to be fleshed out about this new program, what seems clear already is that there are aspects to it that investors will indeed love.

The program creates tax incentives for investing in certain low-income census tracts that have been designated as qualified opportunity zones (QOZs). The QOF/QOZ program was created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and initial guidance on QOFs was issued by the IRS in mid-October.

The hearing was the agency’s first on this new investment vehicle. Uncertainties regarding various aspects of the program reportedly have left some investors and other potential stakeholders unsure about how to move forward with it.

As of now, the Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund has a page with Opportunity Zones resources, including a list of designated QOZs.

A promising program

To get a clearer picture on a program that’s still in flux—but could be a major boon to certain CRE investors and developers—Commercial Property Executive spoke with Edward Renn, a partner with Withers Worldwide, New York, who has closely followed the QOF program’s gestation.

Off the bat, he noted, there’s one key difference from most prior similar programs, in which an investor had to send an application to an administrator. QOF is different: “You don’t need permission from anyone. It’s self-certified.” Also, the program is intended to be broader than similar programs. More than 8,700 census tracts are included, or about 20 percent of low-income tracts nationwide, Renn said.

And the potential benefits are so substantial, he said, that some observers are wondering if the program might be too good to be true, because it provides both tax deferral and a basis bump. “The real magic here is that capital gains on the QOZ property are tax-free if the QOZ property is held for at least 10 years.”

For this and other reasons, Renn said, “There’s a whole lot of interest in this.”

The IRS so far has been responsive and helpful regarding the QOF program, he said, and input from this hearing presumably will be reflected in the next round of regulations, probably to be issued in March. However, Renn does caution investors that “your state tax treatment is going to vary.”

Likely or proposed CRE uses of QOZs include the redevelopment of multi-family properties, repurposing office or warehouse space into hotels, new or renovated strip malls, standalone solar or wind energy projects, and, in theory, even brownfield projects, according to Renn.

Interestingly, some of the designated census tracts, such as Hell’s Kitchen and Long Island City in New York, and the Arts District in Los Angeles, are gentrifying already. “Most of the bang for the buck will come from a few hundred sites,” he predicts.

Overall, Renn said, the program will appeal to investors looking to defer big capital gains—and to developers who have projects needing “reasonably priced, sticky money,” in comparison to current rates for mezzanine debt.

wdio,Opportunity Zones: Private Sectors Investing in Low-Income Communities,"""The federal government has come up with a brilliant program to incentivize investors to pour capital in areas they otherwise wouldn't. It is going to create long-term jobs that will have multiplier affects in all areas,” Brian Forcier, the managing principal for Titanium Partners, said.

""It’s an incentive for people to take earnings that they have on past investments called capital gains, and take the investment and invest it in a designated opportunity zone neighborhood,” Pam Kramer, an executive director for Duluth Local Initiatives Support Corporation, said.

Opportunity zone neighborhoods are communities that need more job opportunities and economic growth. Duluth has opportunity zones stretching from west Duluth to downtown Duluth, Lincoln Park, and the Hillside.

""Some neighborhoods are not benefiting from increase in economy and some neighborhoods need extra investment,"" Kramer said.

This new incentive benefits neighborhoods in need and benefits investors as well.

""The deferral of capital gains tax through 2026 is a meaningful benefit. Money that they invest in funds, if they hold it for 10 years, they don't pay any capital gains taxes,” Jamie Stolpestad, a Minnesota Opportunity Zone advisor, said.

""Any operating business whether it's a product service or real estate developer can benefit from opportunity zone,” Forcier said.

Examples of investments eligible for the program include commercial real estate, multi-family housing, single family housing, operating businesses, and equipment leasing.

The program hopes to attract investors who truly want to make a difference in opportunity zone neighborhoods.

""We're focused on social impact investors not focused just on those tax benefits. They're not just focused on the money, they want beneficial things to occur where they're investing,” Stolpestad said.

Minnesota has a total of 128 opportunity zones.

There’s plenty of opportunities statewide for private sectors to get involved in the effort.

NORWALK — Economic development professionals, real estate developers, investors and members of the public are invited to a “Opportunity Zones Workshop,” taking place in the city next month.

The Greater Norwalk Chamber of Commerce, along with the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, Connecticut’s Department of Economic and Community Development and Pullman and Comley, a law firm with offices in Bridgeport, Stamford and Hartford, are hosting the workshop to educate professionals and community members about the federal program.

“This event will provide a comprehensive background and expert analysis of the new program, as well as recommendations for cities, philanthropies, advocates, and private sector representatives interested in Opportunity Fund creation, operation, and management and equitable development outcomes throughout our nation's newly designated Opportunity Zones,” chamber officials wrote in a statement.

Across the country, more than 8,700 opportunity zones were created as a part of President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The program was created as a way to help spur development by offering tax deferrals on capital gains in specific, designated low-income neighborhoods.

In Connecticut, there were 72 opportunity zones, including three in Norwalk.

The workshop will feature speakers from the Connecticut Economic Resource Center on how towns should prepare for the program and from Connecticut’s Department of Economic and Community Development on the requirements and info about other programs at the state and federal levels.

The workshop is at the Norwalk Public Library from 8 to 10:30 a.m. March 14. It is free. To register, visit norwalkchamberofcommerce.com.

rismedia,The Future of Real Estate Investment: Opportunity Zones,"According to the 2017 Distressed Communities Index by the Economic Innovation Group, one in six Americans, approximately 17 percent of the population, live in economically-distressed communities, and the average state has 15.2 percent of its population living in these struggling areas.

The new Opportunity Zone (OZ) tax incentive was created as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to encourage investment in low- to moderate-income communities across the country through tax benefits, such as deferring tax on capital gains by making an investment in any of the designated zones. So far, 8,761 communities covering all 50 states, including the five U.S. territories, have been designated as opportunity zones, and they will keep this status for 10 years.

The Investing in Opportunity Act has the potential to have a direct social and economic impact upon underserved communities, benefiting investors, communities and taxpayers alike. It is predicted to be a pivotal catalyst for economic recovery, business development and affordable housing, which could help countless individuals achieve financial stability and economic growth for themselves and future generations.

Real estate investors and high-net worth individuals are seeking to take advantage of opportunity zones to use their capital, which otherwise would be sitting on the table, to help their surrounding communities. Thus, industry professionals, especially those in the commercial space, should be informed about the benefits and potential pitfalls of this new investment trend.

Benefits

A Win-Win Situation – Aside from receiving a tax break on their capital gains, investors have an opportunity to make an impact in their local communities.

Low-Cost and Low-Risk – This new legislation is a low-cost and low-risk opportunity for taxpayers. Investors bear the brunt of the risk for their originally deferred capital gains, although they do receive a tax reduction for long-term holdings.

Direct Impact for Economically-Distressed Communities – Low-income and economically-distressed cities and towns—which include over 52 million American citizens—are benefited by having funds funneled directly into programs that can help with job growth, affordable housing, entrepreneurship, and more.

Long-Term Investment – The Act encourages long-term investment by offering a reduction in capital gains taxes owned on their original investments after holding them for five to seven years. In addition, if investors have qualified investments held for more than 10 years, those assets will be exempted from further capital gains recognition over what was deferred originally.

Risks

Opportunity zones are anticipated to be influential in putting capital into areas that need it most, which otherwise would have been left on the table; however, a concerted effort will have to be made to make sure that rural areas are not overlooked for investment in fear of small returns compared to more populated city centers in states such as New York and California.

Revitalizing our distressed communities will help bring more jobs to citizens—especially in the development of hospitality businesses—reduce crime rates, and provide resources and opportunities for more Americans to reach their full potential and improve their quality of life.",2019,02,17,https://rismedia.com/2019/02/17/future-real-estate-investment-opportunity-zones/

rejournals,Opportunity Zone program already making impact in Midwest,"When the Opportunity Zone program became law as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act it brought with it hope for investors and low-income communities. But now that 2019 is well underway, has the opportunity zone program resulted in new projects in the Midwest?

The short answer is “yes.”

The program offers investors financial incentives to bring private capital to those low-income areas designated as opportunity zones. The hope is that this new program will bring much-needed capital to communities that have long struggled to attract investors.

One project now underway in the Minneapolis market is a good example of what the Opportunity Zone program is supposed to accomplish.

McGough has started construction on The Fenley, a 402-unit multi-family complex at Bloomington Central Station in Bloomington, Minnesota. The high-end apartment project is the third multi-family development on the company’s 50-acre master planned site, which has sought to revitalize and create a new mixed-use community in Bloomington’s previously underutilized South Loop District.

The Fenley is one of the first ground-up development projects to be built in Minnesota under the new Opportunity Zone tax program established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

David Higgins, vice president of development with McGough, said that the Opportunity Zone program played a key role in the project.

“It was absolutely a meaningful catalyst for getting our financing closed,” Higgins said. “That is particularly because of the size of our project. At 402 units, we are well above the typical size of a multifamily project in this market. When you do a project that is meaningfully larger than is typical in a market, you narrow the number of investors who might be interested in it.”

Higgins said, though, that the financing portion of The Fenley project moved quickly once the Opportunity Zone program was announced. McGough is now working with an equity partner that had held off on investing in the project until the Opportunity Zone program became law.

“Once the partner realized that the whole South District was in an Opportunity Zone, they came back to the table really quickly,” Higgins said.

Project entitlements were approved last spring and a tax increment financing subsidy was approved jointly by the Bloomington Port Authority and City Council in October 2018. Debt financing was provided by The Northwestern Mutual Life Company. A total of 10 percent of the units at the Fenley will be priced at 80 percent Area Median Income affordable rents with the remaining at a high-end market rate.

Higgins said that he expects the Opportunity Zone program to bring new developments to underserved areas across the Midwest. The biggest challenge? There are a limited number of investors for whom this program will work.

“This requires a special type of investor,” Higgins said. “It’s not a small population, but it’s not for all investors.”

Why? To get the greatest benefit out of the Opportunity Zone program, investors have to hold onto their investments for 10 years. That’s not something every investor wants to do. Higgins said that many investors look to exit their investments after seven years. Some want to exit after just three or five years.

“This program doesn’t work for them,” Higgins said.

The Opportunity Zone program is now making a difference at Bloomington Central Station.The Fenley, designed by ESG Architecture and Design, will feature such amenities as a pool patio with grill stations, bocce court and lounge spaces; top-floor sky-lounge with viewing deck; fitness room with a yoga studio and sauna space; community and party room; work-from-home café lobby space; parking garage with tenant stalls matching the floor of their unit; and a park-side courtyard with supportive ground floor retail space.

The project is located within walking distance of two stops on Metro Transit’s Blue Line Light Rail Transit System. It also offers convenient access to freeways and is near regional amenities such as the Mall of America, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge.

Higgins said that the Opportunity Zone program should help other developers take on projects similar to the Fenley, both in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and across the Midwest.

“Sometimes attention makes a difference,” Higgins said. “The Opportunity Zone program is a way to bring more attention to areas than they otherwise would have gotten. It takes neighborhoods that couldn’t get on anyone’s radar and makes them more attractive. There are other Opportunity Zones in areas that are in a more intermediate state. They would get investments, but it might take longer to make the case for them. The Opportunity Zone can help these areas attract investors much faster.”

The Fenley is the newest result of a long-standing collaborative partnership between McGough and the City of Bloomington, which began with the original acquisition and master planning of the Bloomington Central Station site and included the establishment of a tax increment finance district to further boost the area’s redevelopment.

Upon the project’s completion, McGough will have driven the development of 1,060 housing units on the site, providing new housing opportunities within the City’s South Loop District, ranging from condominium homeownership to market rate rental and affordable unit rental opportunities.

The site is also home to HealthPartners’ and Ceridian’s corporate headquarters offices and a full-service Hyatt Regency hotel. An additional 1.9 million undeveloped square feet is available for commercial and related uses.

Higgins says that the Fenley project is a unique one in the Twin Cities market, one that offers plenty of benefits for its residents.

“It’s just this little urban hub, a mixed-use community where all the pieces are falling into place,” Higgins said.",0,0,0,https://www.rejournals.com/opportunity-zone-program-already-making-impact-in-midwest-20190219

newsandsentinel,Opportunity zones created by federal legislation explained,"PARKERSBURG — Opportunity zones were created as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, but potential investors and advisers are still learning how they might best be utilized.

“The idea behind an opportunity zone is to incentivize individuals who own an asset … to sell that asset and invest those capital gains in distressed areas,” said John Stump, attorney with Steptoe & Johnson in Charleston, during a recent presentation on the topic in Parkersburg City Council chambers.

Capital gains are earned when an investment — such as a stock or building — increases in value. It’s estimated that there are trillions of dollars in unrealized capital in the United States because of investors holding on to assets, Stump said.

“A lot of properties have been owned by families for generations because they don’t want to incur the capital gains” tax, Stump said.

Opportunity zones seek to draw out that money by allowing the taxes to be deferred until the end of 2026 if the gains are invested, within 180 days, in a project in a designated zone. The tax rate is discounted by 10 percent after five years and a total of 15 percent after seven. If the investor holds the new investment for 10 years, there is no tax on its capital gains for that period.

“If somebody has an idea for a business and you want to start a business, boy, you sure would want to do it in an opportunity zone,” Stump said. “If the property goes up in value, at the end of the day, (you have) enormous upside potential.”

Parkersburg Mayor Tom Joyce invited Stump to make the presentation after speaking with him about the topic at a West Virginia Municipal League event. More than two dozen people attended the session, before the Jan. 22 City Council meeting.

The governor’s office designated 55 opportunity zones across the state last year, two of them in Wood County. One includes Parkersburg’s downtown central business district north to Vienna, and the other goes east along Seventh Street to West Virginia 47.

Parkersburg Development Director Rickie Yeager said city officials were consulted by the state on the local designations. Downtown was recommended because of the number of vacant buildings and the need for housing on the upper levels, while Seventh Street is a major commercial thoroughfare.

“Having an opportunity zone in place gives another financial incentive to help support small businesses if there’s a chance they’re going to grow,” Yeager said.

To invest capital gains in an opportunity zone, a Qualified Opportunity Fund must be created.

“There are banks that have half-a-billion-dollar funds targeting opportunity zones,” Stump said. “It can (also) be as simple as a limited liability company with one member.”

There are a wide range of acceptable opportunity zone investments, including startups, affordable housing, rental housing, parking facilities, hotels, restaurants, manufacturing and offices, Stump said. “Sin” businesses, like those involving alcohol and gambling, are excluded.

“It must be an equity investment,” Stump said. “You can’t make a loan.”

In response to a question from a Parkersburg resident, Stump said people investing in properties they already own in an opportunity zone can benefit, but there must be a substantial improvement to it.

Stump said an opportunity zone won’t turn a bad investment into a good one, but it could help a marginal project become successful or make a successful one even more lucrative based on where it’s located.

While there is plenty of interest in opportunity zones, Stump said, there hasn’t been a lot of action on such projects in West Virginia because final rules are still being drafted at the federal level.

David Tenney, managing director for Tenney & Associates accounting and business consulting firm, said he has clients interested in opportunity zone projects.

“I’m working with a couple right now,” he said following the presentation.

Michele Wilson, executive director of workforce and economic development for West Virginia University at Parkersburg, said after the meeting that she serves on several committees throughout the area and believes opportunity zones could be beneficial.

“I think when you invest in these distressed areas, there’s always opportunity to grow our region economically,” she said.

Primary Benefit of Opportunity Zones

* Deferral: Investor can defer taxes on capital gains until 2026 by investing realized gains in a Qualified Opportunity Fund.

* Reduction: Tax liability on deferred gains reduced by 10 percent at five years and an additional 5 percent at seven years.

* Exclusion: Any appreciation in Qualified Opportunity Fund investment accrues tax-free if held at least 10 years.",0,0,0,http://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/business/2019/02/opportunity-zones-created-by-federal-legislation-explained/
ocregister,New “opportunity zones” give investors big tax breaks,"What’s up with mortgage rates? Jeff Lazerson of Mortgage Grader in Laguna Niguel gives us his take.

Rate news summary

From Freddie Mac’s weekly survey: The 30-year fixed averaged 4.37 percent, down four basis points from last week to the lowest level in a year. Thirty-year rates have increased just once in the past 14 weeks. The 15-year fixed rate averaged 3.81 percent, down three basis points from last week.

The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 3.7 percent decrease in loan application volume from the previous week.

Bottom line: Assuming a borrower gets the average 30-year fixed rate on a conforming $484,350 loan, last year’s payment was $2 higher than this week’s payment of $2,996 – the first time in years the payment is lower than a year ago.

What I see: Locally, well-qualified borrowers can get the following fixed-rate mortgages at a zero point cost: A 15-year FHA (up to $431,250 in the Inland Empire, and up to $484,350 in Los Angeles and Orange Counties) at 3.50 percent, a 30-year FHA at 3.75 percent, a 15-year conventional at 3.625 percent, a 30-year conventional at 4.25 percent, a 30-year FHA high-balance (from $484,351 to $726,525 in L.A. and Orange counties) at 4.25 percent, a 15-year conventional high-balance (also $484,351 to $726,525) at 4.0 percent, a 30-year conventional high-balance at 4.375 percent, a 15-year jumbo (over $726,525) at 4.125 percent and a 30-year jumbo at 4.75 percent.

What I think: Talk about a whopper of a real estate tax provision that just might work to your advantage!

Under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, investors can get a big break on their capital gains taxes by investing an economically depressed “opportunity zones.”

Officials recently released guidelines for investing one of these 8,761 government-certified zones, or OZ’s, as they’re called. And they were a hot topic at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s San Diego convention, which I attended earlier this week.

Here are some highlights of an excellent presentation by panelists David Leavitt of PwC and Timothy Lee of Signet Partners:

You’ve sold something for a profit that triggers a capital gain tax. The capital gain must be recognized prior to Jan. 1, 2027. A few examples are the sale of real estate, stocks, or a business. Some examples of eligible taxpayers are individuals, partnerships, trusts, corporations and REIT’s. Within 180 days of the sale, the profit is invested in an Opportunity Fund, which in turn buys real estate in a Qualified Opportunity Zone. Examples of OZ investment funds are tangible property used in a trade or a business that substantially improves the property or stock in a domestic corporation. You get to defer the capital gain taxes that you owe Uncle Sam until 2026. You get to reduce your capital gains taxes owed by 10 percent if you hold your profits in this fund for at least five years. For example, say you have invested a capital gain was $100,000 in an OZ. After five years, you’d pay taxes on $90,000. A seven-year hold means an additional 5 percent reduction in capital gains taxes, or taxes on just $85,000. If you hold that Opportunity Zone Fund Investment for more than 10 years, you have zero capital gains taxes on any appreciation realized when you sell. For example, if you invested $1 million (excluding the capital gains taxes you paid in 2026) and sold it for $2 million 11 years later, no capital gains tax. Holy Mackerel! You cannot invest in golf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, hot tub facilities, liquor stores, race tracks, gambling establishments, or suntan facilities. Funny enough, no restrictions on cannabis facilities.

Be mindful, there are still lots of unanswered questions regarding these recently released guidelines. I strongly suggest you get counsel from your tax advisor or tax attorney.

saportareport,Georgia’s struggling areas could benefit from smart use of federal opportunity zones,"Share Pin 42 Shares

By Guest Columnist BUZZ BROCKWAY, vice president of the Georgia Center for Opportunity

Buried in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was a provision that, if used wisely, could benefit investors, while at the same time knocking down barriers to human flourishing in struggling areas of our state. Championed by U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, opportunity zones allow an investor to defer capital gains taxes for up to 10 years, if the gain is invested in a Census tract designated as a qualified opportunity zone.

Following guidelines in the law, last year then Gov. Nathan Deal designated 260 Census tracks across 79 Georgia counties to be federal qualified opportunity zones. Sixty percent of these Census tracts are in rural areas of our state, while 40 percent are in areas considered urban.

Experts estimate approximately $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains existed in the United States at the end of 2017. While no one expects all that money to flow into opportunity zone investments, it’s clear to see this program has the potential to direct massive investment into areas desperately in need of it.

The opportunity zone concept is not a new one. Presidents Clinton and Obama both implemented versions of this idea, with admittedly mixed results. What can we learn from previous attempts to direct money into low-income areas, and how can we set this program up for success?

In 1980, New York Congressman Jack Kemp introduced the Urban Jobs and Enterprise Zone Act. His goal was to use a variety of tax credits and incentives to encourage the creation or retention of small businesses within areas identified as high poverty and low employment. The bill never passed, but Kemp continued working on the issue while in Congress and as secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Kemp envisioned a simple, easy to use program, focused on the unique needs of each particular community. Yet, when Congress finally enacted Kemp’s idea in 1993, it created a complex, one-size-fits all system, which ended up rewarding big businesses and wealthy developers. Not surprisingly, the transformation envisioned did not take place. Attempts by the Obama administration to revise the program proved similarly unfruitful, causing some to declare the concept a failure.

However, what Kemp envisioned, and what Scott added to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is a program that is easy to understand and easy for people to invest in. If we follow their vision, I believe the chance of it succeeding is high.

According to the IRS, the new law provides that investors may be able to defer tax on almost all capital gains they invest after Dec. 31, 2017, through Dec. 31, 2026. To qualify for deferral, criteria that must be met includes:

Capital gains must be invested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) within 180 days;

The fund must hold at least 90 percent of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property;

Investment in the QOF must be an equity interest, not a debt interest.

These requirements are simple, flexible, and community focused. With an eye toward staying on this path, let us consider a few key principles to making opportunity zones a success:

Resist the temptation to regulate and micro-manage

It is important that local governments do not add complexity to opportunity zones through zoning ordinances or other requirements. Attempts to micro-manage outcomes, or pick winners and losers, almost always fail. Investments that are locally focused and community driven are more likely to succeed than well intentioned “help” from policymakers and outsiders. Look to the early success the Arthur Blank Foundation and the Chick-Fil-A Foundation are having in Atlanta’s West End. They are laser focused on what people in that community need, and it’s beginning to pay off.

Understand that every opportunity zone is different

Some people in opportunity zones need jobs, other people need affordable housing, others need healthcare, while other opportunity zones need investment in infrastructure. Determine what each unique area needs, and let solutions be locally driven not externally imposed.

Don’t focus mainly on “homerun” projects

Before they backed out, Amazon’s HQ2 in Long Island was set to be located partially in an opportunity zone. While that project would have transformed the area, projects of that magnitude are extremely rare. Don’t let the search for “another Amazon” cause us to miss dozens of other opportunities that could also transform a community, but may not grab headlines.

Focus on people

Above all else, focus on the people who live and work in these opportunity zones. The goal of directing investment into these areas of our state is to allow people to flourish and follow their own dreams. While investors in opportunity zone projects will surely benefit financially, it’s important to keep in mind there are real people in each opportunity zone and the benefits of any investment should primarily seek to meet their needs.

Opportunity zones as designed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people across our state. With attention to the unique needs to individual people in each opportunity zone, we can create opportunities for human flourishing that will lift our state to even greater heights.

uli,Opportunity Zones and Human Capital: Insights from the Marshall Plan,"Following World War II, western Europe’s municipal and rural economies were devastated. In response, the United States in 1948 launched the Marshall Plan to provide $13 billion of capital and assistance for the rebuilding effort.

Seventy years later, in 2018, the U.S. government moved to spearhead the revitalization of its own urban and rural areas by creating opportunity zone (OZ) tax incentives codified in the controversial 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Adjusting for inflation, the Marshall Plan’s $13 billion investment would represent about $136.5 billion in current dollars. In contrast, the OZ incentives will be energized by the potential of an estimated $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains, cash parked in various assets and sitting on the tarmac of the American economy—and, legislators hope, ready to soar into reinvestment opportunities.

To be clear, these new zones are unlikely to attract anything near that $6 trillion figure. But they do not need to in order for the incentive to be hugely successful. If America’s emerging urban markets can attract just 2 percent of that potential pool, OZs would rival—and perhaps surpass—the Marshall Plan in terms of economic impact. But unlike the Marshall Plan, which was deployed for only four years, these zones will be operational for at least the next 10 years. Time is of the essence to fully capitalize on those benefits of tax deferral and tax reduction.

I recognize that the analogy should not be overstated. The zone initiative is radically different from the Marshall Plan’s provision of government loans and grants. The OZ program is market driven and focused on the attraction of equity capital for business development and real estate projects in distressed areas. The OZ capital will have the freedom to be scalable and concentrate investment where risk-adjusted underwriting dictates. Project investments can be as big and transformative as necessary to succeed. There will be no additional political decisions of how much investment should go where.

However, history suggests that one of the most important factors for the success of the OZ incentives will be something that the Marshall Plan recognized: the importance of cultivating local human capital for a redevelopment effort. A critical component of the Marshall Plan was its capacity-building technical assistance in which corporate managers from European countries were invited to learn modern management skills through study trips to the United States.

Similarly, the pools of capital forming to pursue OZ development and investment deals constitute unique opportunities to cultivate human capital for inner-city economies. Not only does economic justice dictate that this should happen in order for the program to embrace the American ethos of opportunity for all, but also it is consistent with the intent of the legislation’s key sponsors.

In a February 5, 2018, interview on the Fox Business Network, one of those sponsors, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, expressed his vision. “What we hope to see is a real investment of time, talent, and treasure into these areas—and by doing so, they will excavate the hidden talent in these communities and put them to work right in their own backyards,” he said. Scott’s cosponsor, Senator Corey Booker of New Jersey, likewise advocates for human capital development, having also introduced legislation to stimulate apprenticeship programs in private industry.

But, aside from furthering these policy objectives, the cultivation of managerial talent mirroring OZ communities is ultimately in the vested interest of commercial real estate (CRE) stakeholders.

First, inclusion of talented women and minorities at all levels of the project investment process will take the political spotlight, helping maintain a favorable legislative environment for the incentives.

At some point, Congress, the executive branch, or both will ask whether the tax incentives have accomplished all the intended policy goals—both those expressed and those implied. It will be in the country’s interest to highlight numerous examples of professionals of color working at all levels of management on the projects that OZ capital will fund—and not just as laborers on construction sites. That human capital should also include the minority business owners and developers who will have grown and thrived as a result of collaboration with larger firms on OZ deals.

Second, bringing talented minorities into CRE deals enhances project work teams by incorporating diverse perspectives of local markets and business practices. Will viable opportunities in OZ census tracts be dismissed because of failures to read neighborhood potential? Will risks be appropriately managed for those opportunities that are pursued? Will development programs in emerging markets be properly configured to serve the interests of the users and tenants attracted to those markets?

This value proposition of diversity is particularly critical for those real estate sectors engaging in direct interface with consumers. The shopping center industry discovered this decades ago when its evolution was enhanced by the recruitment of women as marketing directors, leasing agents, and other positions—particularly since women were the dominant customers patronizing those malls and marketplaces.

More recently, the National Multi Housing Council and the National Apartment Association have published estimates that by 2030 the United States will need to build more than 4.6 million apartment units at a variety of price points. That will be two years after the first OZ investments will have reached the 10-year holding period that promises the most lucrative tax benefits. That will also be just 15 years before the majority of the nation’s population will be made up of members of minority groups, according to Brookings Institution projections.

So will female and male professionals of color be involved in developing, building, financing, leasing, and owning those commercial real estate assets? Will they be recruited to bring their talents to projects where millennials and members of generation Z will live, work, shop, heal, and lodge while they are traveling?

The pools of minority talent to support the impending capital flows into Opportunity Zones already exist—or they are waiting to be hired and cultivated. Project REAP—the Real Estate Associate Program, the nation’s leading diversity and inclusion initiative serving the CRE industry—has been educating and promoting such talent for 20 years.

It continues to connect real estate organizations with ambitious professionals in nine major metropolitan markets and is poised to expand its network into additional cities. The real estate divisions of numerous companies—including JP Morgan Chase, Walmart, Shake Shack, JLL, Netflix, Howard Hughes Corp., Starbucks, Duke Realty, the Bozzuto Group, Nike, and RXR Realty—have all hired Project REAP alums and discovered that diverse talent enhances organizational growth.

As the industry is poised to tap what may be the most significant pipeline of financial capital ever created for inner-city economic development, CRE executives should be cognizant of the role that human capital plays in redevelopment projects. It was a keystone to the success of the Marshall Plan and the European nations that subsequently became trading partners for American companies.

siliconprairienews,How Opportunity Zones could bring Kimmy Schmidt’s sweet Netflix cash back to Middle America,"There is an innovative new program created by recent changes to federal tax law that could incentivize investment in startups across the middle of America. That program is called Opportunity Zones, and it’s piqued the interest of economic developers and startup ecosystems in several cities.

The new law allows governors to create Opportunity Zones by designating up to a quarter of their state’s census tracts as economically distressed. Once that occurs, a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) can be created. That fund can be used to invest in startups within the Opportunity Zone.

The federal government also incentivizes investors to put their money into QOFs.

How?

Let’s say my investment in Apple pays off, and I have capital gains of $10,000. I can defer and (after staying in the fund for five years) reduce my taxes on those original gains if I invest my $10,000 in a QOF. If I stay in the QOF long enough, I can further reduce and even ultimately eliminate both the entire original capital gains tax as well as taxes on further gains resulting from the success of QOF investments.

For midwestern startup ecosystems, one of the most important provisions of the new law is that investors do not have to live in Opportunity Zones to invest in a QOF.

We can use a real-life example to illustrate why that provision is a potential game-changer.

Ellie Kemper is the star of the Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. She also played receptionist Erin Hannon during the last four years of The Office. She grew up in St. Louis, and her family founded Commerce Bank.

Ms. Kemper obviously has strong ties to the city. She could reinvest the capital gains she receives from her other investments into a QOF. The creation of this program would incentivize her—and other, less-famous former residents of the Silicon Prairie—to invest in the economic growth of a community she has strong emotional and family ties to, even though she no longer calls St. Louis home.

You don’t have to be a television star to invest in Opportunity Zones. All along the coasts there are potential investors who still wear their Cardinals, Royals, and Cornhusker hats on game day. They still come back for Thanksgiving to see their friends and family. In their heart—no matter where they lay their head—a cornfield at the edge of town will always feel like home.

You don’t need to leave a city to invest in Opportunity Zones, but the ability to attract funding from outside the region represents one of the few tangible ways to bring money into the Midwest that would otherwise remain on the coasts. At some point, simply telling the world there are investment-worthy startups outside of Silicon Valley isn’t good enough. The Midwestern entrepreneurship community has tried that. Opportunity Zones create real and necessary incentives for coastal capital to flow into the Silicon Prairie.

While Opportunity Zones are new, a handful of cities across the country have already started creating investment vehicles using them. Erie, Pennsylvania—located in the largely industrial northwestern corner of the state—has set up the Flagship Opportunity Zone Development Company and will soon begin pitching investors. Cities like Erie that recognize the potential of the program early on will have the best chance at building robust funds.

Investors will not put their money into Midwestern startups simply because it is the right thing to do.

There have to be real financial incentives.

One of those incentives can be a 10x return on a game-changing startup. With Opportunity Zones, another incentive can be deferred and reduced capital gains taxes.

That’s great news for capital-starved founders.

And it’s great news for the small and mid-sized cities across America that have made entrepreneurship a focus of their economic development strategy.

shreveporttimes,Taking advantage of a grand new Opportunity (Zone),"Liz SwaineGuest Columnist Liz Swaine (Photo: Liz Swaine's office)

Hang with me for a little, because we’re going to be talking math. Math is one of those things like speaking Klingon. Either you have the knack or you don’t, and one wrong inflection can mean the difference between ‘Please don’t kill me right this moment,’ or ‘Please don’t make it a lingering death.’ (Klingons are a pretty hostile lot.)

In 2017, Congress passed a new tax bill called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It was a major change in the way business is done, and CPAs, tax preparers and the Internal Revenue Service are still trying to both figure it out and implement it. There is a lot buried within the sweeping legislation, but something that can be a special benefit to Shreveport and our historic downtown is a program called the Opportunity Zone.

I am not a tax specialist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express recently and feel marginally confident that I can give you at least an idea of the opportunities these Opportunity Zones create. Though I’ll be focusing on downtown Shreveport, everything I describe applies to every Opportunity Zone.

Over the years, I have worked with investors and developers looking for ways to make money. I do not have a problem with this, especially if in making money they restore and reopen old buildings, help create businesses and jobs and imbue downtown with more fun, excitement and vibrancy. Examples are the difference that the Lofts at 624 with its street-front Rhino Coffee have made to the 600 block of Texas Street and the foot traffic created in the 500 block of Texas with new retail and restaurant options. Developers were responsible for all of this, and these are the types of changes we want to see. The problem with development is that it can be a risky proposition and developers, investors and bankers are generally risk-averse. For obvious reasons, they want to be reasonably assured that they will make money if they spend money, and in many areas, such assurances are hard to come by. This is where the Opportunity Zones step in, in a most creative way.

There are five Opportunity Zones in Shreveport; one covers the greater part of our downtown. They work like this. Let’s say you sold a building or some stock recently and did really well. You’re happy and so is Uncle Sam, because he’s going to be sending you a sizeable tax bill on those capital gains. There are ways to mitigate the tax burden of the gains- like moving to a lower tax bracket state- but the Opportunity Zone doesn’t force you to do something that drastic. What it does is lessen the tax burden while creating investment and businesses in areas that need it.

Here’s the nutshell version. You make money (capital gains) on an investment. Within 180 days, you use those capital gains to purchase an existing building or construct one in an Opportunity Zone. By doing so, you can defer paying taxes on your original gain for up to eight years. If you hold the property for seven years, 15% of your original gain could be excluded from taxes forever. If you hold the property for ten years, any gain you make on that property is excluded from taxes. What?! This is major, folks, AND it helps communities. Investments in Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) in Opportunity Zones can’t just be to buy or build something and then sit on it and wait for the price to rise. We have enough of that foolishness going on already.

To realize the benefits, investors will have to substantially improve the property, and at least 50% of the gross income from the business in the property will have to come from the active conduct of trade or business. Those requirements that encourage investors to do well by doing good could mean big things to downtown Shreveport and other Opportunity Zones. I have just scratched the surface of the possibilities of these zones and how the program works, but one thing is certain- this is a limited time offer on the part of the government, who is, of course, always here to help. Give it some study and give us a call. I promise we can help you find the perfect downtown spot for your next opportunity.

mountainx,Letter: ‘Opportunity Zones’ highlight need to defend neighborhoods,"Pursue a policy, however misguided, for long enough, and you’re almost certain to see results. After half a century of ethnic cleansing, the East End — which proudly describes itself as Asheville’s oldest African-American neighborhood — is, according to the Census Bureau’s latest estimates, two-thirds white.

In part, at least, that change can be traced to the three apartment complexes that were dumped among the single-family homes on the slopes of Beaucatcher Mountain.

With interest rates rising, there was at least some hope that the pace of such unwelcome changes would slow. But no. The 2017 tax law includes the designation of Opportunity Zones — a tax dodge that allows speculators to avoid some or all of the tax due on their activities, helping to offset part, at least, of increased interest rates.

Crucially, there is no requirement that projects financed this way demonstrate any benefit to their host neighborhood, either before, during or after they are completed. It doesn’t take much imagination to figure out what kind of investments will be heading our way — not because Asheville is a cool city, or because our neighborhoods need help, but to avoid paying taxes.

Most of the city, apart from downtown, has been turned into a playground for property speculators, local or distant. Our only — feeble — weapon to restrain their excesses is ensure that the county and city aggressively deploy the land-use and zoning tools they have to defend our neighborhoods. Otherwise, our ability to resist will be like that of a video game hero stumbling into the final boss’s lair with just the wooden shield and rusty sword he had when he started out.

Council Resolution 18-269 of Oct. 23 last — with its promise to “promote equitable growth, development without displacement and healthy communities of opportunity for all residents in and around Opportunity Zones” — seems like a hopeful sign. But the highly visible evidence of the hotel gold rush is not.

bisnow,PNC Backs Local Developer's Opportunity Zone Project In Kensington,"Want to get a jump-start on upcoming deals? Meet the major Philadelphia players at one of our upcoming events!

PNC Bank is making an opportunity zone investment in Civetta Property Group's planned apartment building on York Street in Kensington.

A major institutional investor is making an opportunity zone play in one of Philadelphia's fastest-growing neighborhoods.

PNC Bank Opportunity Zone Fund is investing $8M in a 52K SF apartment building to be developed at 2120 E York St. in Kensington, the Philadelphia Business Journal reports. Civetta Property Group is the developer and part owner of the project, investing $2M of its own capital as equity. PNC Bank is providing $2.5M in debt for the project, according to data from Reonomy.

Civetta purchased the 13,500 SF lot on York in April for $1.2M, or $89/SF, from the owners of the factory that had operated there for decades, but had been vacant for years at the time of purchase. Civetta has demolished the factory in anticipation of its development, the PBJ reports.

When built, the project is slated to contain 57 apartments across four residential floors, with 6K SF of retail on the ground floor. Civetta estimates the cost of construction at $12M, co-founder Michael Tomasetti told the PBJ.

Like much of Kensington, the lot sits within an opportunity zone, but one that was seeing the beginnings of a development boom before the program came into effect. The challenge of developing in Philadelphia's many impoverished neighborhoods means that for now, the bulk of opportunity zone interest in the city has focused on areas already being developed, such as Kensington and the North Broad Street corridor.

commercialobserver,"In Transition: Bridge Lenders Talk Competition, CLOs and Opportunity Zones","If you’re a bridge lender in today’s crowded debt markets, you’d best be on your A-game. Three of the industry’s best gave MBA CREF19 conference attendees an overview of the current transitional lending environment and how they’re staying ahead of the competition.

There was plenty to talk about. A tidal wave of capital has flowed into the bridge lending sector—partly spurred by an increased amount of dry powder in the private equity space and capital moving out of core and into value-add opportunities—and it doesn’t seem to be retreating any time soon.

Despite being forced to duke it out for most deals, panelists were refreshingly complimentary when quizzed about the seemingly never-ending stream of competitors in the ring, with Matt Salem, the head of real estate credit at KKR, describing his challengers as “extremely sophisticated.”

KKR’s loans range from $50 million to $500 million, but the competition starts to thin out around the $100 million to $150 million spot, Salem said. And while competing on spreads—which have compressed around 100 basis points (bps) over the past 12 months from LIBOR +375 bps to LIBOR +275 bps—is de rigueur, there’s no toying with structure or proceeds, unlike the pre-crisis days. “Our borrower base won’t take additional proceeds,” Salem said. “It’s a pretty healthy market from both a credit and structure perspective.”

As the bridge sector continues to evolve, as does what constitutes its collateral, with Salem pointing to KKR’s $214 million loan to Related Beal for its $276 million acquisition of 451 D Street in Boston’s Seaport District as a perhaps “less likely” bridge loan. The asset was 80 percent occupied at the time and KKR’s three-year loan (with two one-year extension options) carried a coupon of LIBOR plus 2.4 percent.

But, perhaps unsurprisingly—given the advanced age of the cycle (which at this point will die of old age before anything else, some attendees said) and transitional lending’s inherent risk—sponsorship remains key.

ACRES Capital is focused on heavy value-add bridge lending— with an average loan-to-value of 65 percent—and utilizes a hands-on approach with sponsors and managers. “We’re extremely sponsor-driven,” said Marty Reasoner, a managing partner at ACRES said. “We look at the manager, their experience and whether or not the business plan works.”

Exit strategies aren’t far behind, with ACRES factoring in downside scenarios and placing “heavy” importance on asset management, Reasoner said. The lender recently opened a Chicago office and is finding opportunities in the Midwest, which isn’t so institutionally banked.

John Lippman, a senior director at New York Life Real Estate Investors (NYL) said that his firm looks at transitional lending opportunities wearing a construction lender’s hat when determining whether the deal represents appropriate risk-adjusted returns or not. The lender did $7.2 billion in originations last year, the majority of which were fixed-rate, but has “re-formalized our involvement in bridge lending,” Lippman said.

Increased bridge lending activity has been fueled by the white-hot CRE collateralized loan obligation market, which acts as a financing vehicle for transitional lenders. A potentially worrying pattern is that loans are increasingly originated to fit the requirements of rating agencies’ profiles in terms of size and cash flow, panelists said.

When opportunity zones—the buzz word of the year thus far—popped up panelists agreed that, well, there are no direct opportunities yet. While panelists expressed some hope that the incentive will help with take-out financing for assets that are already in designated opportunity zones, the general consensus is that if the deal doesn’t make sense minus the incentive it’s simply a losing asset which happens to be in an opportunity zone. Fundamentals have to be firmly in place to make a deal work, and it’s preferable to be lending in a market that is already growing.

When the conversation swung around to asset types, panelists were in agreement that retail remains a tricky bet for transitional lenders.

KKR’s lending portfolio comprises roughly 80 percent office and multifamily assets, with retail properties accounting for only “low single digits,” Salem said. The precarious element to bridge retail lending is the sector’s uncertainty coupled with its transitional state, meaning that lenders have to bet on the tenants as well as the real estate. “You need a crystal ball to see what will happen over time,” Salem said.

ACRES isn’t shying away from retail but gravitates towards quality infill locations, and assets that can be repositioned into a different use. “We’re not afraid of it,” Reasoner said. NYL is also primarily focused on adaptive re-use opportunities.

Industrial opportunities are few and far between, of course, and therefore the most coveted. “There’s investor demand but no product,” Lippman said.",2019,02,14,https://commercialobserver.com/2019/02/transition-mba-lenders/
bisnow,"State Treasurer: California Is Open For Business, Will Comply With Opportunity Zone Program","Want to get a jump-start on upcoming deals? Meet the major Los Angeles players at one of our upcoming events!

Newly elected California State Treasurer Fiona Ma is on a mission to support the governor's effort to build more housing in California through the new opportunity zone program.

Since taking office earlier this year, Ma and her staff have been busy on the road across the state, meeting with business leaders at community and professional business forums.

Deputy Treasurer for Housing and Economic Development Jovan Agee and California State Treasurer Fiona Ma speak at the Opportunity Zone Expo in Los Angeles.

With California Gov. Gavin Newsom stating he wants to build 3.5 million new housing units in the state by 2025, Ma sees the new opportunity zone legislation that allows investors to place projects in low-income areas in exchange for a tax benefit as a way to meet the new governor's lofty housing goals. Newsom's proposed budget is circulating in the state legislature.

Though some expressed concerns whether California might enforce the mandatory state 13.3% capital gains tax after the sale of an opportunity zone project, Ma said that is not the case. California is one of 12 states that had yet to conform with opportunity zone benefits for tax year 2018 as of November, according to KPMG.

""The good news is through [the governor's] budget, we want to fully conform with the federal government in terms of opportunity zones,"" Ma said as the keynote speaker at the Opportunity Zone Expo in downtown Los Angeles.

""Everyone here in California that wants to stay here, invest here and build their projects here, we want you to stay here,"" she said. ""California is open for business.""

Ma’s statement capped off a full day of workshops regarding the new federal legislation at the Opportunity Zone Expo held at the JW Marriott.

About 1,000 people attended the event, highlighting the growing interest from investors, developers, wealth managers and commercial real estate brokers in the opportunity zone space.

“We expected 300 and we have 1,000 people,” OpportunityZoneExpo.com CEO Ali Jahangiri said. Jahangiri said he is planning another opportunity zone conference in Las Vegas in May.

Passed under President Donald Trump's trillion dollar Tax Cuts and Jobs act in the end of 2017, the opportunity zone program allows investors to roll over capital gains or invest traditionally through a qualified opportunity fund on a property or a project in a designated opportunity zone, which are low-income and distressed areas, in exchange for the deferment or elimination of capital gains depending on the length of the investment.

The governor of every state last year designated opportunity zones based on census data.

California has 879 designated opportunity zones, the most in the nation.

There are 1,000 projects proposed in opportunity zones in California, according to Ma. More than half — 59% — are multifamily projects.

Ma said it is her office's goal to increase the supply of affordable and market-rate housing.

Ma said she is in the process of overhauling the state Treasury Department to streamline the development process. Her office is promoting a website that shows the state's excess land and makes it easier for investors to locate projects across the state.

""We are behind some of the other states that have been doing a little bit more in terms of [promoting their cities’ economic development] in conferences, on websites and webinars, but we are going to be catching up pretty quickly,"" Ma said. ""We're revamping [the] office to do business. We want to be customer-friendly, host roundtables and introduce you to projects.""

She said on top of the opportunity zone program, developers planning to build affordable housing in these OZ areas could also apply for the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee program, which manages the state’s tax-exempt bond allocations for affordable housing projects.

Developers could also apply for the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, which administers the federal and state Low-Income Housing Tax Credit programs.

""The only way to meet our housing goals is all of you,"" she said to a room full of commercial real estate investors and developers. ""We need private investments and that is where we come in. We want to be the matchmakers. We want to introduce you all to projects that are out there and ready to go but lack the some of the funding to make the deal pencil.""

Ma's deputy treasurer for housing and economic development, Jovan Agee, said in order to face the state's housing crisis everyone has to be on the same page.

""If we're truly going to walk the talk, if this is truly a crisis, it's going to take everyone irrespective of their political safe corner to figure out how to loosen our grip so slightly,"" Agee said about housing issues. ""It's going to take all of us. ... You see what the governor is doing and what our office [State Treasury] is doing ... a culture shift is happening.""",0,0,0,https://www.bisnow.com/los-angeles/news/economic-development/ca-state-treasurer-california-is-open-for-business-state-will-comply-with-opportunity-zone-program-97354

ssir,How Foundations Can Help Opportunity Zone Communities Succeed,"(Photo by iStock/iamnoonmai)

The Opportunity Zone tax incentive–passed in amended form as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017–is a potentially powerful new tool for helping low-income communities. By providing breaks for certain investments in distressed areas, it has already led to the creation of nearly $1 billion in new funds. Officials from the Treasury Department expect $100 billion in private capital will be deployed through the incentive.

But the policy may fail to achieve its goals unless foundations guide investments in the right direction. Their deep experience in struggling local communities around the nation prepares them for the challenge.

Lawmakers passed this policy with the belief that investors don't pay enough attention to the breadth of good financial opportunities available across the United States. But investors may still worry that low-income neighborhoods present more risk than other areas. And they may only use the Opportunity Zone tax break to enhance investments they would have undertaken anyway, rather than pursue potentially lower-return projects that truly help local communities.

Failure to address the challenges the Opportunity Zone policy seeks to solve has ramifications for a critical factor in communities' health around the nation: the distribution of jobs. The majority of new employment in the United States over the past 10 years has come from the formation of new businesses, yet between 2010 and 2014 half of America’s new firms were concentrated in just 20 counties. Entrepreneurs and small business leaders in undercapitalized areas around the country need help, or their communities will fall further and further behind.

Fortunately, foundations already know how to serve as the connective tissue that channels investment to marginalized regions and nascent economic ecosystems. Here are their four proven approaches:

1. Support Independent Transaction Advisors

Since Opportunity Zone areas are now indirectly competing with each other for tax-advantaged capital, local public officials, association heads, business leaders, and other community constituents need expert advice to develop investable deals and recognize alignments of interest with new investors.

Transaction advisors—private and independent experts who work with local government officials to prepare a pipeline of potential private sector investments—can provide it. They helped Power Africa, launched under President Obama in 2013, deliver more than $5 billion in private investment for energy projects on the historically undercapitalized continent in the program's first five years. Their efforts contributed toward lining up at least $10 in private funding for each $1 in public funding, demonstrating that well-placed funds can drive high multiples of market-rate capital towards beneficial investments.

Foundations who wish to support local champions in Opportunity Zones can use their limited funding to directly embed independent transaction advisors in city governments, local associations, or community nonprofits. There they can help prioritize projects, provide financial expertise, and become the focal point for Opportunity Zone investments. If enough experts are deployed nationally, they can form a powerful knowledge-sharing network, help develop appropriate metrics of success, and replicate approaches that work from one area to another.

The California Opportunity Zone Partnership from Accelerator for America, for example, will use experts from metropolises in California to advise leaders in smaller cities on attracting productive investment. Foundations could encourage similar programs across the country.

2. Support Policy-Aligned Fund Managers

By supporting fund managers who align their efforts with the intent of the Opportunity Zone policy, foundations can signal the best investment options among many, and in the process reduce financial risk for other investors and channel money to where it's most needed. They can do this by:

Providing guarantees that would reduce the risk of investing in a fund by compensating investors for a pre-specified amount of losses.

Taking on first-loss positions in a fund’s investments.

Supporting new innovative fund structures.

Seeding new fund managers.

The federal government has a long track record of funding innovative businesses and investing structures through programs such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), In-Q-Tel (IQT), and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). By taking early stage risks that the private investing market wouldn’t bear, these institutions have used relatively small amounts of dollars to achieve massive impact. Foundations can occupy a similar space.

Access Ventures, an investment fund in Louisville, Kentucky, for example, has been rebuilding the low-income neighborhood of Shelby Park. Over the last five years, through a combination of investments, loans, and grants, the organization has supported local businesses and created more than 200 jobs. It is partnering with Village Capital, a small business investment fund based in Washington, DC, to replicate this experience nationally in places such as Atlanta, San Antonio, and Kansas City. Both Access Ventures and Village Capital were seeded and developed with public and foundation support.

3. Be Hyper-Local

When the Kresge Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation issued a request for letters of inquiry from aspiring Opportunity Fund managers, 113 of the 141 respondents were raising funds with an explicit state or local focus. This embrace of geographic specificity indicates that foundations will likely have many chances to support Opportunity Funds that share a focus on the same communities, while also giving them a position from which to ensure new capital goes toward inclusive growth.

Fund managers would benefit from such partnerships at all stages of the investment process. Before investment, they would enjoy access to community expertise that foundations have built around across the country, including recommendations for mission-aligned local investors. With foundations' help, fund managers could also identify promising local projects that aren't quite off the ground and help move them toward investment readiness.

Foundations could use program-related investments to support development of local entrepreneurs or the re-skilling of local workers. And once investments are ready, foundations can provide first-loss guarantees or other forms of support. Finally, they can help investors broker successful exits to other local investors years down the road.

In Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, the Incourage Community Foundation partnered with the local chamber of commerce to launch more than 20 programs. One of them, an entrepreneurial boot camp, helped launch more than 40 local businesses. The collaboration also led venture funds to support the programs and created workforce training that benefitted a dozen local companies. By combining its philanthropic efforts with local community investment, Incourage drove inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

Foundations that replicate approaches like Incourage's would have the chance to direct a whole new pool of capital towards inclusive investments in the local communities they already serve. They would also define what a beneficial project looks like for a local area, drawing in further investment from others who want to see their dollars go to work in a policy-aligned manner.

4. Develop and Track Success Metrics

Investing alongside the private sector will help foundations exert influence over the goals and success metrics of new Opportunity Funds—an especially important undertaking because the policy currently lacks impact reporting requirements. And by directly supporting new funds, foundations have the chance to shape fund managers' definitions of equitable growth and ensure periodic reporting on those measures. It shouldn't be too far of a reach—investors increasingly want partnerships with socially driven institutions to help them embed sustainable development measures into their financial goals.

There are already efforts in the foundation community to develop and publish standards for Opportunity Zone investments. Existing frameworks, such as the Social Progress Index, can also be used to develop best practices.

Harm or Help?

As the Opportunity Zone tax incentive enters the mainstream of the investment world, foundations have a choice. They can allow the policy to fall prey to the view that it is just another tax cut for the wealthy and an accelerator of gentrification. Or they can drive the policy closer to its intended outcomes by forming the much-needed connective tissue between private investors, community leaders, and the public sector.

12 different in-county census tracts have been qualified as Opportunity Zones, spanning from Port Chester to Tarrytown.

By Richard Sarkis

Westchester opportunity zone map from Reonomy

Since their release at the end of 2017, Opportunity Zones have been the darling of the commercial real estate community, especially in the Lower Hudson Valley. The federal tax program stands to spur economic development in distressed census tracts throughout the United States by offering tax breaks on capital gains to investors who hold assets for at least five years. With such valuable benefits at stake, properties values are rising as investors and developers scope out these nominated areas’ potential.

Despite the fact that most of New York’s Opportunity Zones are located in New York City, there’s plenty of census tracts peppered throughout New York State hungry for investment. In Westchester County, particularly, 12 different census tracts have been qualified as Opportunity Zones, spanning from Port Chester to Tarrytown.

Interested parties know the potential is there, but with demand rising, how can they strategically find these properties before others do? Especially in Westchester County’s most lucrative submarkets, like office and multifamily, it’s vital investors have a tool to quickly locate and analyze workable options.

Modern commercial real estate (CRE) technology backed by off-market data can transform the Opportunity Zone prospecting process, from initial phases of sourcing through deal-making. As competition for these zoned assets heats up in Westchester County and beyond, this robust technology enables users to streamline their Opportunity Zone property pursuit to close deals before the competition does.

The Off-Market Difference

tam | adobe stock

Although “on-market” listings and promoted sales provide a decent baseline for investors interested in Opportunity Zones, they only allow a myopic view of what properties are available. Seasoned real estate professionals will know that everything has a price, and while some assets might not be listed as “for sale,” it doesn’t eliminate them from consideration.

CRE technology, like Reonomy , utilizes a comprehensive off-market data trove to deliver the nation’s entire commercial real estate supply. Comprised of both listed and unlisted properties, this data makes possibilities limitless — in and outside of Opportunity Zones. Users can search specifically for assets in designated census tracts while layering on a variety of geospatial and transactional filters for maximized results. Ultimately, those who leverage this information have a wider, enriched scope of properties to consider, opposed to those who only rely on sales listings.

In addition to its expansive range, the depth of this data is equally invaluable. Particularly in deal-making where its imperative to be armed with ample information, rich, granular asset data, including sales, debt and ownership records, can empower stronger deals.

Hyperspecific asset criteria sourced during prospecting can be used to leverage more flexible negotiations directly with property owners, instead of elusive LLCs and other gatekeepers. In Opportunity Zone deal-making where demand is already high, this information can help users stand out from the competition by personalizing a pitch and securing a higher chance of closing a deal.

An Ascending Office Market

denisismagilov | adobe stock

Due to its vicinity to bustling New York City without the lofty rent prices, Westchester County has seen recent success in the office sector. In White Plains, particularly, office space is a hot commodity; overall vacancy rates have decreased from 22 percent to 15 percent over the past three years.

Rents are at an all-time high as well, topping $40 per square foot. Additionally, Newmark Knight Frank reported nearly 450,000 of leasing activity throughout Westchester County at the end of Q3 2018--an increase 35 percent from the quarter before. Such positive indicators point to positive growth, something local professionals should consider when exploring the area’s Opportunity Zones.

Reonomy data indicates 4,747 different commercial assets situated in Westchester County’s Opportunity Zones. More than 110 of these properties are categorized as office, and include specific buildings like medical and financial spaces. This also includes the 546 mixed-use properties that likely include additional office spaces. Investors who want to take advantage of the market’s success can leverage technology like Reonomy to explore properties on an individual level. This allows them to see physical details, like lot size and total units included, as well as transactional data, like most recent sales price or lender. This allows potential buyers to know their office spaces inside and out before making a formal offer.

Industrial ‘Flex’ Spaces in High Demand

Adobe Stock

Industrial assets are garnering attention throughout Westchester County, as well. Warehouses are especially of interest; these big-box spaces, often referred to as “flex” spaces for their adaptability, are being repurposed into offices and showrooms across the Lower Hudson Valley. Various big-name companies have already taken advantage of the area’s more affordable prices, like Tesla, who recently leased a 35,000-square-foot warehouse in Greenburgh as a showroom and service center.

There are currently 219 different industrial assets in Westchester County’s surrounding Opportunity Zones, including storage units and “big-box” warehouses. For investors interested in renovating these types of assets, users can search for buildings over a certain size using CRE technology.

For example, Reonomy data indicates there are 170 different industrial assets over 5,000-square-feet. This does not include the 250+ generalized commercial assets also in the platform that are of the same size. Professionals looking to strike a deal can dive deeper into these individual assets to uncover owner information and, in turn, take the next step in investing in Westchester County’s Opportunity Zones.

There’s no doubt demand for these designated properties will only continue its trajectory. Rather than falling behind the competition and losing out on the area’s prized properties, CRE technology and off-market data are the key to making smarter, savvier purchases.

qns,Gianaris to introduce legislation delinking state tax breaks for federal Opportunity Zones,"Fresh off of his appointment to the state’s Public Authorities Control Board — which could hold a veto over the proposed Amazon HQ2 deal — Queens state Senator Michael Gianaris continues to flex his muscles by going after federal Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZ).

Gianaris announced he will introduce legislation to eliminate tax breaks for capital gains while investing in QOZ’s.

“The Opportunity Zone program was intended to help economically distressed areas but is being abused to grant tax breaks to already overdeveloped neighborhoods,” Gianaris said. “The state should not be made to suffer due to the misuse of this program.”

The federal tax overhaul passed in 2017 included a provision aimed at incentivizing investment in economically distressed areas. In 2018, the state was supposed to designate census tracts that qualified as “Opportunity Zones” but also included other areas already suffering from overdevelopment and gentrification. Among these areas are wealthy parts of Long Island City and Astoria, among the fastest growing neighborhoods in the United States.

Investors who create opportunity funds to invest in these census tracts are able to defer large capital gains on their federal taxes. Much of New York’s tax code is linked to the federal tax code and Gianaris’ legislation would prevent a massive and unjust giveaway of state resources to the wealthy.

Gianaris began drafting the legislation when he learned the Amazon HQ2 campus would be located in an Opportunity Zone. Amazon declared it would not pursue Opportunity Zone incentives last month.

Gianaris has been at the forefront of the opposition movement against the state and city’s deal to bring Amazon to Long Island City for an incentive package worth nearly $3 billion in taxpayer funds which Gianaris and others say should go to affordable housing, crumbling transit and schools.

In December, Gianaris announced legislation aimed at curbing insider dealing in real estate deals after Amazon employees reportedly purchased condominiums in Long Island City in advance of the company’s decision to locate it HQ2 campus along the Anable Basin on the East River.

Gianaris continues to stand against the Amazon deal despite the release of a HarrisX poll that shows 77 percent of registered voters in his 12th State Senate District approve of Amazon’s planned HQ2 campus.",2019,02,07,https://qns.com/story/2019/02/07/gianaris-to-introduce-legislation-delinking-state-tax-breaks-for-federal-opportunity-zones/
prnewswire,Reno to Host Northern Nevada Opportunity Zone Summit March 19 and 20,"RENO, Nev., Feb. 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- An educational summit aims to educate investors, business owners, and commercial real estate experts on the vast potential Opportunity Zones present in the Northern Nevada market. Recently named the nation's fastest-growing job market, experts are eyeing the Reno region as a boon to investors.

""The untapped potential here is astounding,"" said Kaya Bromley, JD, MSW, a developer, author, entrepreneur and title speaker at the event. ""The shift in this market is happening rapidly and the time to strike is now.""

The Opportunity Zone Program is a tax incentive established by Congress in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Its purpose is to foster investment into low-income and rural communities by allowing those who invest to defer and reduce their capital gains liability and potentially pay no tax on earnings from the investment. There are 8,700 designated opportunity zones nationwide, and analysts predict that billions (and potentially trillions) of capital gains dollars will be invested into Opportunity Zones.

Known as the architect of opportunity zones, Steve Glickman will keynote the Reno event, offering critical insights to the inception of the tax incentive program from the ground up.

The Northern Nevada Opportunity Zone Summit will be held in Reno at the Silver Legacy Reno Ballroom on March 19 & 20, 2019. Event details can be found online at RenoZoneSummit.com .

About the Northern Nevada Opportunity Zone Summit

The Northern Nevada Opportunity Zone Summit is a collaborative event organized by the Reno Sparks Opportunity Zone Task Force, the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN), and the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED). Each group is comprised of national and regional leaders in business, real estate, accounting, law, and commercial real estate development. Both are invested in the long-time success of the Northern Nevada market and are invested in helping the region realize its full potential as a leader in business and community building.

LAC DU FLAMBEAU - A business development agency in the Northwoods pictures new homes, apartments, and jobs coming to Lac du Flambeau in the next decade. Building those and making them a reality may get a boost from a new tax deferral process.



Lac du Flambeau has been identified as an ""Opportunity Zone."" Essentially, it allows investors to avoid paying taxes on capital gains through things like profits made through trading stocks.



The LDF Business Development Corporation wants to see those investors put that money into projects that would benefit the area. Those investments can be made tax-free for up to 10 years if the projects help an Opportunity Zone.



There is further benefit, in that capital gains liability decreases each year the investor stays with the project.



""Maybe they don't live here, but they vacationed here and they want to make a difference,"" LDF Business Development Corporation COO Randy Soulier said. ""They want to take advantage of what they can. It becomes a win-win overall. You know, investor and the area.""



Lac du Flambeau is one of 120 ""Opportunity Zones"" in Wisconsin.



Soulier thinks the investors can provide capital for projects like housing and workforce development that benefit LDF and beyond. He hopes to make Lac du Flambea a destination people want to both vacation and work in.



""Trades or upgrading technology know-how,"" Soulier said. ""I would really like to see the area become more self-(sufficient) on its own.""



The LDF BDC will co-host an informational seminar on Thursday, Feb. 21 at the Lake of the Torches Conference Center from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Registration is free, but required. The Vilas and Oneida county economic development corporations, Grow North, and WHEDA are also presenting the event.

Featured: Impact Voices

Bobby Turner: Successful Opportunity Zone investments will pull people up, not push them out. The former hedge fund partner turned impact investor is an outspoken contrarian on the Opportunity Zones legislation included in the 2017 U.S. tax bill. It’s not that low-income, inner-city neighborhoods don’t need the infusion of capital. “Of all the factors stifling America’s underserved communities, a dearth of economic investment is among the most pernicious,” Turner writes in a guest post on ImpactAlpha. It’s that the legislation doesn’t overcome the perceived risks that are the main reason institutional capital has stayed away from disadvantaged communities. Turner fears Opportunity Zones will leave many investors wondering, “What good is a capital gains tax break on an investment that is likely to lose money?”

Reducing those risks requires humility, empathy and other skills not always taught in business school, Turner writes. “A top-down, ‘we know best’ attitude in working with communities is the surest path to failure.” Workforce housing developments operated by Turner Impact Capital include after-school tutoring programs, neighborhood watches and health and wellness services on site, he says. Professionals who provide services to fellow residents get discounted rent. The results: “Improved quality of life, higher tenant satisfaction rates, and longer lease terms – a winning model for everyone,” according to Turner. Such outcomes are unlikely for Opportunity Zone investors that seek to change the character of a neighborhood by building luxury apartments or destination retail, he writes. “Fulfilling the spirit of the Opportunity Zone ideal means pulling people up, not pushing people out.”

barrons,Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Swaps Partner in Opportunity Zone Fund,"Text size

Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital has replaced the partner it had selected to run its new opportunity zone fund.

The decision to drop EJF as the subadvisor for the SkyBridge Opportunity Zone was made on Jan. 9, a little less than a month after the fund’s launch, after brokers expressed concern about their ability to sell the fund to clients if the investments were being directed by a firm without a track record in real estate.

SkyBridge’s president, Brett Messing, told Barron’s that the split was “amicable and smooth” but that “sometimes business relationships just don’t work out.” He described the opportunity zone fund as “the biggest initiative that SkyBridge has ever had in terms of the outlay of money,” and stressed that a fund that the big brokerage houses couldn’t get behind wouldn’t have been a success for either party.

In EJF’s place, SkyBridge has selected Westport Capital as the subadvisor for the opportunity zone fund. Westport brings “tremendous pedigree...with a lot of development and redevelopment experience, which is what is required to comply with the opportunity zone regulations.”

A spokesman for EJF said in a statement that “EJF has substantial real-estate experience and looks forward to continuing to identify and execute on attractive and socially responsible real-estate investments in Opportunity Zones through its strategy that pre-exists the SkyBridge Opportunity Zone REIT.”

SkyBridge launched its opportunity zone fund on Dec. 11 to take advantage of the favorable capital gains treatment real-estate investments in specific, low-to-moderate income neighborhoods can reap as a result of the tax cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump.

“We launched the SkyBridge-EJF Opportunity Zone REIT in response to demand from investors, who correctly see the OZ program as a chance to potentially generate attractive returns while having a positive societal impact,” Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and co-managing partner of SkyBridge Capital who was briefly White House communications director for a brief time, said in a press release at the time. “We worked with EJF to structure the product in an investor-friendly way to democratize access to this historic incentive.”

Soon after the fund was launched, however, SkyBridge began to hear from the brokers who form the backbone of the company’s sales network that EJF’s lack of a record in direct real-estate investments would make it difficult for them to successfully pitch the fund to clients and the decision was made to end their involvement in the opportunity zone fund.

As developers across the state take advantage of opportunity zones created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a moratorium on development in the city of Boulder’s designated opportunity zone is stymieing companies that want to redevelop their properties to expand their businesses.

Boulder has put a moratorium on development in its opportunity zone.

Earlier this month, the Boulder City Council adopted an emergency moratorium ordinance to suspend the acceptance of building permits, site-review applications and other development applications that would result in adding nonresidential space or demolition of multifamily dwelling units within the opportunity zone. The moratorium is in effect until June 22, 2020.

The city was the first in the nation to reject its own opportunity zone.

The moratorium hasn’t gone over well with the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, which fears that investors won’t participate in an opportunity fund to invest in the OZ as the value of the tax incentives diminishes with each passing year.

“In general, we think the moratorium is an irresponsible way to practice land-use planning,” said Boulder Chamber of Commerce President and CEO John Tayer, who is a panelist at Bisnow’s Opportunity Zones Denver event March 13. “There is the concern that we are going to miss the opportunity to use this land-use vehicle in our community.”

Denver Housing Authority fought to get Sun Valley Homes into an opportunity zone.

To take advantage of the full benefits of the incentive, an investment must occur before the end of this year, according to the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.

“While OZ investments will continue after this date, communities and projects that organize themselves quickly will have an easier time attracting capital,” the office's website states.

Last year was the first year the opportunity zone program was available for investors. The program was authorized for seven years, so the clock is ticking for communities to take advantage of it.

The opportunity zone program provides a federal tax incentive to invest in low-income urban and rural communities through favorable treatment of reinvested capital gains and forgiveness of tax on new capital gains.

Boulder’s single opportunity zone, certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in April, is roughly bounded by 28th Street to the west, Diagonal Highway and Independence Road to the north, Airport Road and 55th Street to the east and Arapahoe Avenue to the south. The 2.5-square-mile area includes about 4,000 households and 1,500 businesses, including Google and Macy’s.

“It’s a huge part of the core of Boulder,” said Holland & Hart Senior Planner and Development Project Manager Liz Hanson, another Bisnow event panelist. “It not only includes a main shopping area outside of downtown, it also includes an industrial area, the Google campus and some housing areas that tell you why this was chosen as an opportunity zone.”

Substandard housing is precisely why Denver Housing Authority fought to get its 60-year-old Sun Valley Homes public housing development into an opportunity zone, but Executive Director Ismael Guerrero, another Bisnow panelist, said there are still many unanswered questions about how to best leverage the redevelopment tool.

Bisnow/Margaret Jackson

Sun Valley is home to some of Denver's most vulnerable residents.

“It’s like a Rubik’s Cube,” Guerrero said. “You get one side to look good, and the other four are not where they need to be. We’re trying to figure out how to leverage new investments into an underserved community in a way that benefits the residents.”

DHA has been working for years on plans to redevelop Sun Valley, which is home to some of Denver’s most vulnerable residents. The organization already has engaged stakeholders in the area to establish guidelines about development so that work can start when investors are ready to contribute to an opportunity fund. After DHA accepts funds, it has six months to start a project, so it is important to be sure work is ready to start on any OZ projects.

“We’ve got people working on getting a fund structure in place that can receive the investment dollars,” Guerrero said. “Now we’re making sure we have a pipeline of projects so that as we get investment, we’re ready to deploy. We’re hopeful, and there’s almost an urgency to have a fund established and an initial project this year.”

Investors also expect to have a return with appreciation within 10 years, so it is important to structure projects in such a way that they can be repaid within that time frame. The entry and exit requirements raise the question of what asset classes are ideal for opportunity zone investments, Guerrero said.

“From a public policy perspective, any time you have these kind of initiatives that have a sunset, the closer you get to that sunset date, the more uncertainty there is and the less attractive it is to new investors,” he said. “The challenge we have with community development is that some of the big, early money is going to flow to the projects that are the easiest — where there’s more certainty and less risk.”

Colorado has 126 census tracts designated as opportunity zones.

Meanwhile, development sites in opportunity zones near the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora and near the light-rail station in Westminster have attracted the attention of Foster City, California-based Legacy Partners. Legacy, which has a regional office in Denver, is working with an investment partner to create a fund that will invest in the projects.

Legacy at Fitzsimons, across from the Anschutz campus on Colfax Avenue, will be a 363-unit market-rate apartment complex that will be marketed to nurses and technology workers. Legacy had the ground under contract before the area was declared an opportunity zone.

“That just brought more players and partners to the table,” said Legacy Vice President of Development R. Lane Cutter, another Bisnow panelist. “We’re ahead of the game because one turned into an opportunity zone right in front of our face.”

Legacy also is working on buying property in an opportunity zone in Westminster where it wants to build 350 apartments with retail and commercial space at street level near the light-rail station at Federal Boulevard and Westminster Station Drive.

“It makes sense as an opportunity zone,” Cutter said. “It’s a little bit rougher and can use some development help. This program could help development and clean up what’s there and make it more walkable, more accessible and more attractive.”

prnewswire,Saratoga Group Set to Launch a Yield-Oriented Opportunity Zone (OZ) Fund,"AUBURN, Calif., Feb. 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Saratoga Group has announced that they will be launching a yield-oriented Opportunity Zone (OZ) Fund in February 2019. ""Almost exclusively, OZ funds are oriented towards ground up or major redevelopment projects,"" says Sam Hales, CEO of Saratoga Group. ""The advantages of an Opportunity Zone investment for shielding a capital gains windfall are tremendous. However, most development projects are accompanied with significant idiosyncratic risk relative to construction costs, timelines, and economic cycles. These risks are difficult to quantify, even for sophisticated real estate investors.""

Saratoga Group is specifically investing in Mobile Home Communities (MHCs) located in Opportunity Zones. Currently, they have 12 communities under management with plans to purchase another 15-20 in 2019.

Sam Hales continued, ""Asset prices are universally near record highs and real estate is no exception. Although there has been some CAP rate compression for mobile home communities, over 90% of MHCs are owned by non-institutional owners. This is one sector where true 'value-add' opportunities are still available."" MHCs help fill the under-served affordable housing market. Unlike other forms of real estate, these communities typically experience consistent demand during recessionary cycles.

About Saratoga Group

Other projects include land subdivisions, in-fill urban residential projects, office buildings and a boutique hotel. Since 2017, Saratoga Group has been almost exclusively focused on the acquisition and improvement of Mobile Home Communities.

talkbusiness,Delta Regional Authority lays out details of new federal Opportunity Zones; Arkansas Senate passes enabling legislation,"A panel of legal and business experts on Wednesday (Feb. 6) provided an in-depth overview of the new federal Opportunity Zone rules that local and state economic officials hope will boost poor and distressed communities across the state.

The discussion on the new federal program, which was inserted in the omnibus $1.8 trillion Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed by Congress in December 2017, was part of the agenda at the three-day annual meeting of the Delta Regional Authority held at the downtown Marriott Hotel in Little Rock and occurred just as the Arkansas Senate passed a bill in support of the program.

Under the 2017 tax cut plan approved by Congress, President Donald Trump’s administration strongly backed a new Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service program establishing qualified Opportunity Zones to spur investment in distressed communities across the country through a new federal capital gains tax incentive.

After beginning the panel session with a video message from U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, the chief sponsor of the new federal program, local attorney Scott Lar with Quattlebaum, Grooms and Tull said states are still awaiting some guidelines and modifications related to enabling legislation from the Treasury Department.

“Like most of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, this piece of legislation is still subject to technical corrections, which we may or may not ever get,” said the Little Rock attorney. “We are awaiting clarification on a few issues and some additional guidance. We do have one round of initial guidance and we will talk through that …”

According to U.S. Treasury officials, the new federal incentive program will allow private investors to defer payment of taxes on capital gains on profits they earn on investments in the certified zones. They must invest the money through a corporation or partnership that was organized for that specific purpose.

Under the rules, the investor’s fund must hold at least 90% of its assets in qualifying property. Nearly a year ago, governors from all 50 states could nominate up to 25% of eligible areas by March 21, 2018 as designated zones in their respective locales, based on census tract data. In May, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson received word that the U.S. Treasury had approved his nominations for 85 such zones in Arkansas.

Bryan Scroggins, director of business finance at the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, told the DRA panel that Arkansas selected 85 zones out of 337 qualified tracts. He told a roomful of DRA attendees that the state’s nominations were based on the potential to attract investment and the likelihood of economic success.

After Hutchinson announced the qualified opportunity zones in Arkansas in May, AEDC Director Mike Preston said he would work closely with communities to find the right investment opportunities. Another panelist at the DRA conference, Arkansas Capital Executive Vice President Leslie Lane said each state and each community will have to figure what projects will work best to bring new investment and economic developed projects in distressed rural and urban communities across Arkansas.

“There is not a cookie-cutter way that every state is trying to address this (program),” said Lane.

As of today, the U.S. Treasury has already designed Opportunity Zones in 18 states. Those chosen as “qualified opportunity zones” will retain that designation for a decade. Investors can defer tax on any prior gains until no later than Dec. 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a so-called Qualified Opportunity Fund investment vehicle that targets the designation distressed areas.

In addition, if investors hold the investment in the fund for at least ten years, they would be eligible for an increase in its basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that it is sold. Unbeknownst to the DRA panelists, which also included Quattlebaum attorney Kenneth Hall and Arkansas Venture Center Chairman James Hendren, the Arkansas Senate passed a bill about an hour before the discussion began that opens the door for Arkansas to be certified under the federal program.

Senate Bill 196 by Sen. Keith Ingram, D-West Memphis, was unanimously approved by a 35-0 vote after several senators praised the federal program as a way to bring investment to Arkansas, noting that the bicameral Tax Reform and Relief Task Force endorsed the program. On the Senate floor, Ingram called the Opportunity Zones the best thing to come out of the $1.8 trillion 2017 Tax Cut Act that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

“It makes it very attractive for businesses to come in a (distressed) census area,” Ingram said. SB196 is now referred to the House Revenue & Taxation Committee, where is also expected to get a friendly reception. Gov. Hutchinson and AEDC have also expressed their support for the legislation.

A list of nominated zones and a map of nominated zones can be found at the AEDC website, here and here.

The DRA is a federal-state partnership created by Congress in 2000 to help create jobs, build communities, and improve lives through strategic investments in economic development and infrastructure projects in 252 counties and parishes across eight Delta states, including Arkansas. The authority’s three-day annual meeting in Little Rock, which included a reception at the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion, ends on Thursday.
