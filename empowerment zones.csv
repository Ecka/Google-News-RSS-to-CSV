nrdc,Illinois Could Be America's Next Clean Energy Leader,"The Clean Energy Jobs Act that was introduced today would move Illinois to 100% renewable energy by 2050 and make our state a national leader in clean energy and climate action.

Clean energy

The bill (SB2132/HB3624) would rapidly ramp up renewable energy in Illinois towards the 100% target by 2050, starting with a target of generating 45% of our electricity from renewable sources – and none from fossil fuels – by 2030. That rapid expansion of clean energy would place Illinois at the forefront of job growth, investments, customer savings and health benefits from renewable energy.

The bill would also grow the Illinois Solar for All Program by as much as 500%, expand cost-saving energy efficiency programs, and help us plan our electric grid in ways that avoid unnecessary costs and take advantage of increasingly cheap renewable energy.

Clean transportation

Putting more renewables on the electric grid also makes it easier to clean up our transportation sector, which is now the largest source of carbon pollution in Illinois. Although electric vehicles already pollute less than gasoline-powered vehicles, as the electricity we use to charge those vehicles gets cleaner, we can reduce pollution even more. At the same time, electric vehicles paired with smart charging technologies can help our electric grid run more efficiently. The Clean Energy Jobs Act aims to take advantage of these opportunities while removing the equivalent of one million gasoline-powered vehicles off the road.

New incentives and infrastructure to support electric vehicles would help spur this process, including support for “light duty” electric vehicles like cars and trucks, which can save drivers money and create 70% less pollution than similar gas-powered vehicles. It would also include incentives to transition towards electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which is critical in part because many of today’s heavy-duty vehicles run on diesel and cause serious health problems for people in communities with heavy truck traffic. The bill also pairs electric vehicle incentives with smart charging programs to ensure that electric vehicles can charge at “off-peak” hours (such as late at night) when electricity is relatively cheap, plentiful, and clean. Finally: in addition to expanding electric vehicles, Illinois should expand non-motorized transportation options like walking, biking, and mass transit, which could be included in a capital bill.

Jobs and equity

The transition to a clean energy economy promises benefits to our health (as we saw in 2016), our climate, and our pocketbooks. It also creates jobs: Illinois is already home to nearly 120,000 clean energy jobs. Statewide, about one in every 50 workers is in the clean energy sector. In rural Illinois, clean energy already employs twice as many people as fossil fuels, and those jobs are growing at 5% a year even as the total number of jobs in rural areas has declined. The massive expansion of renewable energy envisioned in this bill would grow those impressive numbers even further.

But the benefits of our energy transition must be equitably distributed, and the jobs it creates must be good-paying and accessible. The transition must prioritize economic opportunity for people of color, people who live in environmental justice communities, and workers impacted by the transition away from fossil fuels.

The Clean Energy Jobs Act centers these priorities through Clean Energy Empowerment Zones, which allocate economic development resources to communities impacted by the transition away from fossil fuels, and the creation of Clean Jobs Workforce Hubs. These hubs are workforce development pipelines that begin with recruitment conducted in partnership with community groups, unions, and others, and which prioritize recruiting people of color, people from marginalized communities, and displaced fossil fuel workers. They include training programs with stipends to help trainees meet living expenses, transportation, child care, and other needs while they develop their skills. Renewable energy developers will be incentivized to hire diverse workers, including graduates of these training programs.

What's next for the Clean Energy Jobs Act

The Clean Energy Jobs Act was developed with the input of people all over Illinois, in nearly 70 public discussions across rural, urban, and suburban communities, from Chicago to Carbondale, with participants of all ages and racial backgrounds.

With a newly-elected Governor who supports 100% renewable energy, recent national polls showing that 85% of registered voters want to move their states entirely to renewable energy by 2050, and the ambitious Clean Energy Jobs Act gathering sponsors in the legislature, Illinois is poised to be a model for clean energy leadership – not just in the Midwest, but in the world.

Beyond the numbers and the policy details, that would mean cleaner air and water, more jobs, healthier people, and a livable world for our kids.",0,0,0,https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jc-kibbey/illinois-could-be-americas-next-clean-energy-leader
forbes,Turning Opportunity Zones Into Real Opportunities With Launch Pad,"Opportunity Zones are the new frontier of economic development. Authorized by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017—and proposed several years earlier by the Economic Innovation Group—Opportunity Zones have caught the fancy of mayors, economic development agencies, private investors, philanthropic foundations, and, inevitably, consultants.

For good reason: Opportunity Zones offer perhaps the best chance for the United States to finally get place-based policy right. History is not encouraging: prior attempts, including Enterprise Zones and Empowerment Zones and others, were underwhelming in their impact (but not their cost). Economists and others had boiled down the experience with place-based policy to a simple dictum: invest in people, not places.

Yet Opportunity Zones might actually be different, thanks in part to their relative simplicity in terms of requirements. The enthusiasm with which they have been taken up all over the country is one indication of the high level of expectation. In a nutshell, Opportunity Zones open up a pathway for private investors to put money into economically-challenged communities, through a variety of tax benefits for the capital invested and gained, conditional on meeting certain requirements. Neighborhoods bereft of investment will (ideally) enjoy an influx of private capital, and investors will earn a nice return. Everybody wins.

There are, of course, skeptics. Some worry that only high-end real estate development will attract investment. Others worry that existing residents of designated Opportunity Zones will not benefit from the potential influx of new wealth and jobs. To allay these concerns, some people have established new entities to help match capital with opportunity, and help funnel investment to high-return projects in high-need areas that might be overlooked. In Alabama, for example, Alex Flachsbart established Opportunity Alabama to do exactly that.

What will really fulfill the economic development promise of Opportunity Zones is an on-ground mechanism to enable investors to support local entrepreneurs. New and young companies are the lifeblood of neighborhoods and cities—they are the principal source of new job creation and become the bedrock businesses for residents. Opportunity Zones could potentially fuel business creation and growth, offering a much-needed boost to economic dynamism in areas where dynamism has largely disappeared. If those new businesses are structured in a certain way—through employee ownership, for example—the social and economic returns would be considerable.

How can this be realized? How can the deal flow be aggregated for investors? And, most importantly, how can those local entrepreneurs be supported beyond just capital?

One organization, Launch Pad, could be the best operating business example to deliver on the promise of the Opportunity Zone legislation and might just be the critical conduit by which Opportunity Zones renew American entrepreneurship and cities.

Started in New Orleans, Launch Pad has opened 3 new cities in 2018, all in Opportunity Zones, with plans for at least 20 by 2020. Launch Pad serves entrepreneurs as a coworking space, convening place, and community center, with a focus on ecosystem collaboration and support of local organizations. It can act as the gravitational point of an entrepreneurial ecosystem.

“Our strategy for growth in what we call 'momentum markets' is a reflection of the importance of entrepreneurship outside the typical startup hubs. Now more than ever great companies can be built anywhere,” said Anne Driscoll, President and co-founder of Launch Pad. ""The introduction of this legislation was the ultimate reinforcement of that plan, and a boost to the impact we can have in cities across the U.S.""

In New Orleans, Launch Pad has helped support hundreds of companies, which have created 5,000 jobs and raised $160 million in capital. Most impressively, from Launch Pad’s 22,000 square feet, its entrepreneurs have graduated to fill over 600,000 square feet of office space in the city. If you’re a mayor or economic development official looking to create jobs and fill space (and who among them isn’t?), it’s hard to think of a better way.

The entrepreneurial ecosystem in New Orleans is still emerging, despite many years of attention and appearance on “top startup hub” lists. In our recent Surge Cities analysis, New Orleans ranked 41st out of 50 overall, and was low on early-stage venture funding deals, low on high-growth company density, and in the middle of the pack on net business creation. The metro area did rank 7th overall in the rate of entrepreneurship, which indicates a strong pipeline of people trying to make it. This reinforces part of Launch Pad’s strength: in contrast to other types of entrepreneurship support organizations, it doesn’t restrict itself only to tech startups. It serves all comers, helping create a truly cohesive entrepreneurial community.

Launch Pad could be the best operating business example to deliver on the promise of the Opportunity Zone legislation.

This, too, is borne out in the data. In Startup Genome’s report on six early-stage U.S. ecosystems, done with the support of the Kauffman Foundation, we found reasons for optimism in New Orleans. On our measure of Local Connectedness, New Orleans scored higher than its peer cities and much higher than other comparable ecosystems globally. Entrepreneurs in New Orleans, we found, have high levels of Collisions (meaning they interact frequently with each other) and Relationships—the entrepreneurial network is dense. Most importantly, New Orleans topped the other cities on Sense of Community, our measure of the culture of giving and receiving help among entrepreneurs. Beneath the surface, Launch Pad has helped foster a strongly supportive community of entrepreneurs.

Launch Pad is not the only support organization for entrepreneurs in New Orleans: trepwise and Idea Village, among others, have been influential as well. But because of its location, its focus on community beyond just coworking, and its commitment to economic development, Launch Pad seems to stand out.

The Opportunity Zone potential is clear, especially since all four Launch Pad locations are in designated Opportunity Zones. In addition to New Orleans, the company has set up shop in Newark, Memphis, and Nashville. In the Surge Cities analysis, Memphis ranked 47th out of 50 overall and was low on all the entrepreneurship-related variables—the impact of Launch Pad, fueled by Opportunity Zone investment, could be transformational in the city. Launch Pad not only is one of the few emerging national Opportunity Zone businesses but also can house and support other businesses through its model.

It’s entirely possible that Opportunity Zones could renew distressed American communities through entrepreneurship. For that to happen, however, capital must be directed to those entrepreneurs. And for that to happen, an organization like Launch Pad needs to be at the center of any economic development strategy.",2019,02,06,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danestangler/2019/02/06/turning-opportunity-zones-into-real-opportunities-with-launch-pad/

capitolfax,Your Illinois News Radar » Pritzker transition report: Powering Illinois’ Future,"To subscribe to Capitol Fax, click here. Pritzker transition report: Powering Illinois’ Future Wednesday, Feb 13, 2019 * Moving right along with our look at Gov. Pritzker’s transition reports, let’s take a glance at energy policy. One of the things that transition team members were asked to focus heavily on was capital projects… Improve storm and wastewater management systems The new administration should invest in storm and wastewater infrastructure projects that help protect against property damage, limit soil erosion, and improve climate resiliency, particularly in communities that disproportionately suffer from the impacts of climate change. The state should also ensure there is an equitable distribution of funds across environmental justice communities. The state could leverage State Revolving Loan Funds for these efforts. There are two types of infrastructure projects that the state should prioritize: • Gray infrastructure projects: improve stormwater and wastewater treatment plants to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. • Green infrastructure projects: implement the Illinois Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy, work with conservation districts to drive on-the-ground projects, cost share with conservation entities on edge-of-field practices, and use existing state funds to purchase land for conservation. * Here’s the section on creating community clean energy empowerment zones… The new administration should prioritize the creation of clean energy empowerment zones in rural communities, transitioning communities, and communities of color to ensure all communities share in the economic and environmental benefits of Illinois’ shift to a clean energy economy. Through these zones, the state could provide community empowerment grants to facilitate locally-designed, community-directed clean energy initiatives, such as electric transit, wind and solar, and clean energy workforce development. * More… Expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure In order to address the leading source of carbon pollution in Illinois – the transportation sector – the new administration should expand access to electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure installed by qualified local union labor. The state should authorize funding for this infrastructure and support for electric distribution infrastructure to meet EV grid demands. The state could provide incentives for conversion of public transit and school buses, offer special rates to school districts that adopt EV buses, and encourage utilities to build out make-ready work as called for and provide EV supply equipment in communities without access. The new administration could expand this initiative by leveraging capital funds available through the VW settlement and reallocating those funds to clean technologies. Expand Illinois’ energy storage leadership Energy storage is key to a future where the world is powered by renewable energy. The new administration should leverage Illinois’ position as a leader in energy storage and help facilitate incubation of energy storage-related businesses growing out of research conducted across the state. The state could integrate R&D efforts with business creation and compete for federal and private sector clean energy storage investments in Illinois. The state could also incentivize projects that propose locating at retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants in order to spur economic development in those transitioning communities. Support shovel ready solar projects for schools and state-owned properties The new administration should implement the Solar for All program by initiating an additional 100 projects at publicly-owned properties in low-income communities. This would bring an additional 200MW of community solar to Illinois, create local union labor jobs, and generate electricity savings for buildings like public schools.

washingtonpost,"Will ‘Opportunity Zones’ Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?","Buried in the Republican tax overhaul that President Donald Trump signed into law in late 2017 are incentives for investors who fund businesses or develop real estate in new “opportunity zones.” Banks, private equity firms, insurance companies and wealthy individuals are rushing to take advantage. Critics have raised questions about whether the tax breaks will spur development in places that really need it or just stimulate growth in communities that were destined to see investment anyway. Amazon’s planned new headquarters in New York City, for instance, will be located inside an opportunity zone, a fact that’s added to the controversy over the project.

1. What’s an opportunity zone?

It’s a U.S. census tract that meets the law’s criteria for high poverty or low incomes and has been nominated by its state for inclusion. More than 8,700 of all census tracts -- about a 10th -- have won designation as opportunity zones. They’re found in every state, in Washington, D.C. and in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. Some of the rural zones span giant swaths of land out West, while some urban zones are just a few square blocks.

2. Why so many?

Economic growth in the U.S. has been uneven. A handful of cities are booming, while much of the country -- from rural counties to aging Rust Belt towns -- get left behind. Giving investors an incentive to plow some of their $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains into these distressed communities could help jump-start growth, create jobs and lift incomes. Nearly all of the opportunity zones have poverty rates north of 20 percent or family incomes that are lower than 80 percent of the state or metro median.

3. What’s the problem?

There’s a debate over whether investors will pile into places that were already seeing development. An analysis by the Urban Institute found that most of the zones are in fact hurting -- fewer than 4 percent had experienced an influx of wealthier, college-educated people that would signal gentrification. But in Washington, D.C., about a third of the tracts have seen significant socioeconomic change. Critics also note that there’s no requirement that investments in opportunity zones benefit the community.

4. What about the Amazon site?

The New York City opportunity zone where Amazon plans a new headquarters-- with waterfront views of Manhattan -- is one of about 200 zones nationwide that are adjacent to low-income areas without being low-income themselves. The poverty rate for the Long Island City tract is less than 10 percent and the median household income is about $137,000, higher than any other opportunity zone in the state, according to the most recent census data. Faced with a barrage of criticism over the more than $2.5 billion in subsidies it was promised for the project, Amazon announced in January that it wouldn’t make use of opportunity zone tax breaks. But it could still benefit indirectly: A development partner could claim the tax break, then rent space to the retailer at a discounted price.

5. Whose idea is this?

It was hatched in a 2015 white paper by Jared Bernstein, who was an economic adviser to Joe Biden when he was vice president, and Kevin Hassett, who is now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for U.S. President Donald Trump. They wrote it for the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank co-founded by Sean Parker, the Napster creator and first president of Facebook Inc. A group of Republicans and Democrats introduced bills in the House and Senate to create opportunity zones in 2016, but the measures never reached a floor vote. One of the sponsors, Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, successfully pushed for a modified version that was tucked into the tax overhaul.

6. What are the tax breaks?

Essentially, the plan gives investors two different sweeteners: First, they can defer and reduce capital gains they’ve earned elsewhere by investing those proceeds in an opportunity zone. Second, they pay no capital gains on any opportunity-zone investment they hold for at least a decade.

7. Who decided where the zones are?

After the tax law passed, governors were given 90 days to nominate a quarter of the eligible zones in their state. Many tried to strike a balance between areas that were in greatest need and places that would be more likely to attract investments. The results included some surprising picks, including the arts district in Los Angeles. The U.S. Treasury Department then certified the selections.

8. Wasn’t this tried before?

Not exactly. There have been past efforts at spurring economic development in distressed areas, like the Empowerment Zones that were created during the 1990s. Many of these efforts fell short because of weak incentives and too much complexity. The backers of opportunity zones say the new incentives are simpler, more flexible and significant enough that investors will use them.

9. What will the zones cost?

When the bill was being considered, the Joint Committee on Taxation told Congress that the opportunity zone tax breaks would cost about $1.6 billion through 2027. But the figure would rise after that, as developers claim capital-gains exemptions on the sale of projects in opportunity zones held for more than a decade. Since the program is open-ended, the final tally will ultimately depend on how much money investors plow into opportunity zones and the gains that they realize.

impactalpha,"Successful Opportunity Zone investments will pull people up, not push them out","Follow all of ImpactAlpha’s industry leading Opportunity Zone coverage.

ImpactAlpha, February 12 – Of all the factors stifling America’s underserved communities, a dearth of economic investment is among the most pernicious. For decades, institutional capital has largely bypassed disadvantaged urban and rural areas due to the perceived risk of investing there – whether those concerns are justified or not.

As a longtime investor in underserved communities, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of private sector capital to create jobs, energize schools, revitalize neighborhoods, and ignite hope. I have also faced rejection from institutional investors who are fearful of any number of real or perceived hazards, from lack of market opportunity and narrow customer base to high crime and poor governance.

Overcoming this barrier of perceived risk is critical to incentivize the flow of institutional capital into the places that need it most. In the 1980s and 1990s, smart initiatives such as federal empowerment zones, state enterprise zones and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits successfully attracted billions of dollars of private capital into high-need areas. They provided tangible incentives – credit enhancements, tax credits, and subsidies – that reduced economic risks and helped real estate developers and businesses invest in these areas, and make a profit doing so.

Risk perceptions

The new federal Opportunity Zone investment program currently taking shape fails to deliver the same incentives, particularly for institutional investors. Without them, the program will not achieve its intended goal of revitalizing economically challenged communities. At its core, the legislation aims to attract investors by deferring capital gains on existing investments and eliminating capital gains on new appreciation if an investment is held for more than a decade. In the minds of supporters, this will unleash a torrent of long-term investment.

However, the Opportunity Zone program does nothing to help an uncertain investment become profitable in the first place. For this reason alone, the program fails to address the fundamental reason institutional capital has historically avoided disadvantaged communities – because the risks are perceived to be too great compared to other investment opportunities. It will leave many investors wondering: what good is a capital gains tax break on an investment that is likely to lose money?

The weaknesses of the Opportunity Zone program don’t end there. Many of the world’s largest real estate investors are tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds, university endowments and sovereign wealth funds. These institutions command enormous capital, yet due to their tax-exempt status they will receive no benefit from Opportunity Zones, eliminating any incentive to invest.

And finally, the legislation’s requirement that taxes on deferred gains be paid by 2026 will create intense pressure for some investors to sell assets prematurely to satisfy their tax liability. Not only does this preclude those investors from benefiting from the program’s much touted tax break on new appreciation on investments held for ten years, it also undermines the prospects for stable, long-term investments in high-need communities.

Pulling people up

Even if these concerns are addressed, institutions may find there’s more than meets the eye to succeed in Opportunity Zones. It’s tempting for investors to think that an MBA or well-capitalized spreadsheet is all it takes to thrive in high-need communities. They should think again. If I’ve learned anything in 25 years of investing in underserved communities, it’s that a top-down, “we know best” attitude in working with communities is the surest path to failure.

What is required are skills not always taught in business school: humility and empathy chief among them. My business partner in the early days of urban investing was Earvin “Magic” Johnson. He taught me and some of the most influential institutional investors that successful investments are made not in parcels of land, but in people and communities. Meeting those needs requires listening, and learning, on the part of the investor.

The priorities of our residents have directly shaped the business model of our multifamily housing fund, for example, which operates more than 7,000 units of affordable workforce housing in urban areas around the country. Community members have repeatedly told us that education, safety and healthcare are top priorities for themselves and their families.

As a result, our properties offer resident-focused services to directly address these issues: free after-school tutoring is available for students; police officers and other law enforcement organize neighborhood watch programs; and nurses and other medical professionals offer health and wellness services on-site. Professionals who live at our properties provide these services to fellow residents in exchange for discounted rent. The program has been extremely successful, leading to improved quality of life, higher tenant satisfaction rates, and longer lease terms – a winning model for everyone.

Many Opportunity Zone investors may not be so responsive to their communities, and will instead seek to change the character of a neighborhood by building luxury apartments or destination retail. Fulfilling the spirit of the Opportunity Zone ideal means pulling people up, not pushing people out. Only a program that creates true incentives to invest for the long term and meet the needs of current residents is one that can live up to the promise of its name and create lasting opportunity for all.

upenn,Why ‘Opportunity Zones’ Could Lift Up America’s Struggling Towns,"The $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, was the subject of heated debate about who mainly benefited from the tax overhaul. But buried in the plan was a provision that The New York Times called “the first new substantial federal attempt to aid [struggling] communities in more than a decade.”

The Tax Act created so-called “opportunity zones” meant to stimulate investment in low-income communities. Each state would designate what areas these zones would include. Venture capitalists and real estate developers who place at least 90% of their investment into an opportunity zone can see lower or even no taxes on capital gains depending on how long they stay.

More than 8,700 areas across the nation have been designated as opportunity zones, according to Forbes, and estimates put the number of residents impacted at 35 million. But will this provision truly revive the deep malaise in some of these towns?

“It all sounds great, but of course the devil is in the details,” said John Hollway, associate dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, speaking at the recent conference “Opportunity Zones and Inclusive Community Development.”

Could the incentive be a win-win for both investors and neighborhoods? Will the zones function as they are meant to on paper — helping struggling communities — or will they merely be a windfall for the wealthy? What will be the impact on longtime residents, small businesses and the quality of life?

Among those interested in the answers is John Legend, who was instrumental in organizing the conference and also served as moderator. Although most people know him as an award-winning singer-songwriter, he is also an activist for community development, education and criminal justice. Legend said that while he is “blessed and fortunate” to be able to make music for a living, being in his position also enables him to convene discussions on important topics and to help “impact people’s lives who are often overlooked and not heard.”

“You can’t be a not-in-my-backyard progressive where you want racial equality, but you don’t want those kids in school with your kids.” –John Legend

Legend grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Springfield, Ohio. “A lot of my city is an opportunity zone as defined by the guidelines of the new legislation,” he said. “I’m very familiar with what it’s like to live in one of these areas.”

Joining Legend at the Opportunity Zones conference were public policy experts, community development representatives and academics alongside real estate developers and investors.

Promise and Peril of Opportunity Zones

“In today’s economy, you’ve got a record number of people in places getting left behind,” said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization. He said that often top-line national statistics don’t reflect local realities.

Lettieri termed America’s economic growth “geographically fragmented … on a scale we’ve never seen before.” He asserted that post-Great Recession, the most prosperous 20% of ZIP codes are generating more net new jobs, businesses, population growth and advanced degree holders than the remaining 80% of ZIP codes combined, “by a long shot.”

What those other 80% of ZIP codes lack, said Lettieri, is access to long-term equity capital. At the same time, many American businesspeople have done very well post-recession. There has been much wealth accumulation, which could be used for “very powerful purposes,” he said.

Louis Dubin, a partner at the D.C.-based real estate developer Redbrick LMD, commented, “I’ve never seen — my career — so much capital looking for a home.” Lettieri added that many investors are seeking guidance for where to place their assets because “they don’t know how, they don’t know where, and they don’t want to do it alone.” The opportunity zones incentive could lead them to “scale in places that desperately need it.”

As for any potential risks for developers when investing in low-income communities, could legislation like opportunity zones be enough of a game-changer to make it worthwhile? Dubin noted that the cost of capital has plunged from double-digits to “probably in the single digits.” This means that real estate projects that were “marginally doable” have become doable.

However, additional regulations and legal guidance around opportunity zones are still being issued by the IRS. Dubin said he was looking to the first quarter of 2019, when “we’ll start to get a lot more clarity on how this is all going to work, and some of the early best practices around the issue.” He added, “It’s a very exciting time in our business, but we’re being cautious.”

Margaret Anadu, managing director of the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, said the firm invests $1 billion annually of equity capital in underserved communities and has been doing so for nearly 20 years. She emphasized the effort and care needed to invest productively. “One of the things we’ve learned — and that’s with Philly, Camden, Baltimore, or wherever we are — is that it’s really hard, and it takes a lot of time, intention and real engagement with stakeholders.”

Goldman provides the capital and relies on information from partnerships with community development organizations, not-for-profits and sponsors ‘on the ground.’ “We don’t spend a dollar until we have spent time with [those organizations,] understanding what the needs are,” Anadu said.

“One of the things we’ve learned … is that it’s really hard, and it takes a lot of time, intention and real engagement with stakeholders.” –Margaret Anadu

And the answer isn’t always straightforward. Sometimes community leaders will disagree about what constitutes progress, she said. Indeed, community engagement must be a front-end process. “Don’t just swoop in and ‘save’ them” with a fully-fledged plan, said one attendee.

One community development organization with which Goldman works is Enterprise Community Partners, a Maryland-based national nonprofit that provides affordable housing across the U.S. Anadu said she appreciated working with knowledgeable entities like Enterprise because the deals in question are typically “incredibly complicated.”

“[Opportunity zones] are one incentive that will push us forward, and will move some of those marginal deals into the ‘go’ column. But it still needs this tax incentive, that tax credit, this local abatement, etc.,” Anadu said. Her group looks for partners who in addition to understanding the “human side and the need side,” know how to get a deal done.

Enterprise’s former CEO, Terri Ludwig, agreed. It’s important to “lift up the local community voice and understand what are the needs, what are the processes, and how can we actually bring something to bear — whether that’s affordable housing, a charter school, a healthcare clinic, or something around job creation.” It really takes a blend of activities to make a difference, Anadu added.

Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, now a Columbia University professor of urban and public affairs, agreed that opportunity zones should be viewed as “one tool of many.” Realistically, any deal that gets done is usually “a half of this, a half of other sources,” he said.

The idea that opportunity zones should be combined with other initiatives to be truly effective — with programs to improve education, employment, medical care, nutrition and criminal justice — was a recurrent theme at the conference. Some said designating such zones is merely a tax incentive, not a program to help distressed communities.

Local governments and community advocates need to be thoughtful and vigilant about how it’s implemented. “The legislation is so broadly written that savvy investors, corporations and real estate developers could exploit it,” according to a Bloomberg article.

Protecting Existing Residents and Businesses

Nutter called for “intentionality” by public officials. “The government should not put itself in a position where it’s a passive actor and just kind of let the wild, wild West happen … and you’re just excited that somebody wants to invest. You have to make some tough decisions,” he said. A mayor should be asking, for example, “Where’s our best impact? What’s it going to do about poverty, about public safety? What’s going on with the schools in that particular neighborhood?”

“The government should not put itself in a position where it’s a passive actor and just kind of let the wild, wild West happen … and you’re just excited that somebody wants to invest.” –Michael Nutter

Nutter also talked about the challenges of revitalizing neighborhoods while not driving property taxes so high that existing residents face eviction. “Not only [should we be] talking about incentives to invest, but also incentives for the ability to stay, and that you don’t end up like my grandmother who used to talk about [being]… house-rich and cash-poor.”

Nutter said when he was Philadelphia’s mayor, he implemented the city’s first-ever homestead exemption — the Longtime Owner Occupants Program — which provided a tax abatement for homeowners whose property assessment tripled or more from year to year, so their taxes would stay affordable.

Other initiatives were discussed: empowerment zones, enterprise zones, renewal communities, down payment assistance, lease-to-own programs for small businesses. It was clear that there was no single formula for success. The point was also made that better metrics are needed: not just dollars funneled into a community, but whether the situation of longtime residents and businesses had changed for the better.

Several panelists commented that historical, systemic racism is partly to blame for the intractable problems of many distressed communities. It was important to acknowledge that, they said. “You cannot overstate how our whole housing financing policy was built around intentional structural racism,” said Ludwig. “How can we be just as intentional about ‘un-designing’ that?”

Anadu ageed. “These communities didn’t become underserved overnight. There were reasons: intentional, legal, historical, racism,” she said. “So, we also don’t think the challenges in these neighborhoods will get solved overnight.”

Legend also noted that “a lot of times folks don’t want to live in the same neighborhood as those people. … You can’t be a not-in-my-backyard progressive where you want racial equality, but you don’t want those kids in school with your kids.” He added, “We all have a responsibility as individuals to not be part of the problem.”",0,0,0,http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/can-opportunity-zones-lift-americas-struggling-towns/
fairobserver,Can “Opportunity Zones” Lift Up America’s Struggling Towns?,"Can “opportunity zones” lift struggling towns? Singer John Legend joined experts to discuss this tax incentive at a University of Pennsylvania Law School conference.

The $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December 2017, was the subject of heated debate about who mainly benefited from the tax overhaul in America. But buried in the plan was a provision that The New York Times called “the first new substantial federal attempt to aid [struggling] communities in more than a decade.”

The Tax Act created so-called “opportunity zones” meant to stimulate investment in low-income communities. Each state would designate what areas these zones would include. Venture capitalists and real estate developers who place at least 90% of their investment into an opportunity zone can see lower or even no taxes on capital gains depending on how long they stay.

More than 8,700 areas across the nation have been designated as opportunity zones, according to Forbes, and estimates put the number of residents impacted at 35 million. But will this provision truly revive the deep malaise in some of these towns?

“It all sounds great, but of course the devil is in the details,” said John Hollway, associate dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, speaking at the recent conference, Opportunity Zones and Inclusive Community Development.

Could the incentive be a win-win for both investors and neighborhoods? Will the zones function as they are meant to on paper — helping struggling communities — or will they merely be a windfall for the wealthy? What will be the impact on longtime residents, small businesses and the quality of life?

Among those interested in the answers is John Legend, who was instrumental in organizing the conference and also served as moderator. Although most people know him as an award-winning singer-songwriter, he is also an activist for community development, education and criminal justice. Legend said that while he is “blessed and fortunate” to be able to make music for a living, being in his position also enables him to convene discussions on important topics and to help “impact people’s lives who are often overlooked and not heard.”

Legend grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Springfield, Ohio. “A lot of my city is an opportunity zone as defined by the guidelines of the new legislation,” he said. “I’m very familiar with what it’s like to live in one of these areas.”

Joining Legend at the Opportunity Zones conference were public policy experts, community development representatives and academics alongside real estate developers and investors.

Promise and Peril of Opportunity Zones

“In today’s economy, you’ve got a record number of people in places getting left behind,” said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization. He said that often top-line national statistics don’t reflect local realities.

Lettieri termed America’s economic growth “geographically fragmented … on a scale we’ve never seen before.” He asserted that post-Great Recession, the most prosperous 20% of ZIP codes are generating more net new jobs, businesses, population growth and advanced degree holders than the remaining 80% of ZIP codes combined, “by a long shot.”

What those other 80% of ZIP codes lack, said Lettieri, is access to long-term equity capital. At the same time, many American businesspeople have done very well post-recession. There has been much wealth accumulation, which could be used for “very powerful purposes,” he said.

Louis Dubin, a partner at the DC-based real estate developer Redbrick LMD, commented, “I’ve never seen — my career — so much capital looking for a home.” Lettieri added that many investors are seeking guidance for where to place their assets because “they don’t know how, they don’t know where, and they don’t want to do it alone.” The opportunity zones incentive could lead them to “scale in places that desperately need it.”

As for any potential risks for developers when investing in low-income communities, could legislation like opportunity zones be enough of a game-changer to make it worthwhile? Dubin noted that the cost of capital has plunged from double-digits to “probably in the single digits.” This means that real estate projects that were “marginally doable” have become doable.

However, additional regulations and legal guidance around opportunity zones are still being issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Dubin said he was looking to the first quarter of 2019, when “we’ll start to get a lot more clarity on how this is all going to work, and some of the early best practices around the issue.” He added, “It’s a very exciting time in our business, but we’re being cautious.”

Margaret Anadu, managing director of the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, said the firm invests $1 billion annually of equity capital in underserved communities and has been doing so for nearly 20 years. She emphasized the effort and care needed to invest productively. “One of the things we’ve learned — and that’s with Philly, Camden, Baltimore, or wherever we are — is that it’s really hard, and it takes a lot of time, intention and real engagement with stakeholders.”

Goldman provides the capital and relies on information from partnerships with community development organizations, not-for-profits and sponsors “on the ground.” “We don’t spend a dollar until we have spent time with [those organizations,] understanding what the needs are,” Anadu said.

And the answer isn’t always straightforward. Sometimes community leaders will disagree about what constitutes progress, she said. Indeed, community engagement must be a front-end process. “Don’t just swoop in and ‘save’ them” with a fully-fledged plan, said one attendee.

One community development organization with which Goldman works is Enterprise Community Partners, a Maryland-based national nonprofit that provides affordable housing across the US. Anadu said she appreciated working with knowledgeable entities like Enterprise because the deals in question are typically “incredibly complicated.”

“[Opportunity zones] are one incentive that will push us forward, and will move some of those marginal deals into the ‘go’ column. But it still needs this tax incentive, that tax credit, this local abatement, etc.,” Anadu said. Her group looks for partners who in addition to understanding the “human side and the need side,” know how to get a deal done.

Enterprise’s former CEO, Terri Ludwig, agreed. It’s important to “lift up the local community voice and understand what are the needs, what are the processes, and how can we actually bring something to bear — whether that’s affordable housing, a charter school, a health care clinic, or something around job creation.” It really takes a blend of activities to make a difference, Anadu added.

Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, now a Columbia University professor of urban and public affairs, agreed that opportunity zones should be viewed as “one tool of many.” Realistically, any deal that gets done is usually “a half of this, a half of other sources,” he said.

The idea that opportunity zones should be combined with other initiatives to be truly effective — with programs to improve education, employment, medical care, nutrition and criminal justice — was a recurrent theme at the conference. Some said designating such zones is merely a tax incentive, not a program to help distressed communities.

Local governments and community advocates need to be thoughtful and vigilant about how it’s implemented. “The legislation is so broadly written that savvy investors, corporations and real estate developers could exploit it,” according to a Bloomberg article.

Protecting Existing Residents and Businesses

Nutter called for “intentionality” by public officials. “The government should not put itself in a position where it’s a passive actor and just kind of let the wild, wild West happen … and you’re just excited that somebody wants to invest. You have to make some tough decisions,” he said. A mayor should be asking, for example, “Where’s our best impact? What’s it going to do about poverty, about public safety? What’s going on with the schools in that particular neighborhood?”

Nutter also talked about the challenges of revitalizing neighborhoods while not driving property taxes so high that existing residents face eviction. “Not only [should we be] talking about incentives to invest, but also incentives for the ability to stay, and that you don’t end up like my grandmother who used to talk about [being] … house-rich and cash-poor.”

Nutter said when he was Philadelphia’s mayor, he implemented the city’s first-ever homestead exemption — the Longtime Owner Occupants Program — which provided a tax abatement for homeowners whose property assessment tripled or more from year to year, so their taxes would stay affordable.

Other initiatives were discussed: empowerment zones, enterprise zones, renewal communities, down payment assistance, lease-to-own programs for small businesses. It was clear that there was no single formula for success. The point was also made that better metrics are needed: not just dollars funneled into a community, but whether the situation of longtime residents and businesses had changed for the better.

Several panelists commented that historical, systemic racism is partly to blame for the intractable problems of many distressed communities. It was important to acknowledge that, they said. “You cannot overstate how our whole housing financing policy was built around intentional structural racism,” said Ludwig. “How can we be just as intentional about ‘un-designing’ that?”

Anadu agreed. “These communities didn’t become underserved overnight. There were reasons: intentional, legal, historical, racism,” she said. “So, we also don’t think the challenges in these neighborhoods will get solved overnight.”

Legend also noted that “a lot of times folks don’t want to live in the same neighborhood as those people. … You can’t be a not-in-my-backyard progressive where you want racial equality, but you don’t want those kids in school with your kids.” He added, “We all have a responsibility as individuals to not be part of the problem.”

A table illustrating how the land tax rates will change under the new legislation (Source: the Budget Statement 2019-20)



Legislation implementing budgetary steps laid out by Curtis Dickinson, the finance minister, has been tabled to go into effect later this year.

The Land Tax Amendment Bill 2019, tabled yesterday in the House, will come into effect on July 1, 2019 if approved.

The Bill is aimed at tourist units such as hotels, cottage colonies and guesthouses, but excludes vacation rental units. On top of a base charge of $300, the Bill imposes charges based on the propertys annual rental value, with a special rate for properties inside Economic Empowerment Zones.

The Financial Services Tax Amendment Act 2019 will impose an extra tax on banks and domestic insurers  although health insurance and the Governments own insurance gets a pass. However, additional landholding charges that had been scheduled to take effect on March 31 this year have been deferred another two years, under the Bermuda Immigration and Protection (Landholding Charges) Amendments Regulations 2019.

governing,"What Are 'Opportunity Zones,' and How Can They Help Distressed Cities?","Distressed Cities Find Hope in Federal 'Opportunity Zones' A new program may be a boon to struggling cities -- if it targets the right ones.

Last Updated Feb. 19 at 4:48 p.m. ET

York, Pa., grew up making things. The brick smokestacks that break up the skyline are inescapable reminders of its industrial past. Buildings that once housed factories employing hundreds of workers have now been converted into warehouses that employ only a handful of people, at wages that don’t come close to rivaling those of their industrial predecessors.

Mayor Michael Helfrich grew up in York. He remembers when middle-class jobs were only a short walk away from the homes of the men and women who produced everything from Pullman cars to Pfaltzgraff dinner plates to York Peppermint Patties. Those companies are gone. Pullman succumbed to competition from Detroit automakers. Hershey’s bought the York candy factory and moved production to its own plants, which eventually landed in Mexico in 2009. Pfaltzgraff was purchased in 2005 and its operations moved to China.

But most of the jobs haven’t left because of competition or consolidation as much as they’ve left to escape York’s taxes, which are almost three times the rate in surrounding York County. The taxes have led to a vicious cycle -- innovation, development and flight -- that has persisted for decades. “We used to build wealth in the city of York,” Helfrich says. “In almost 50 years, we have not seen that. Our growth has been, ‘Can you come here and give us some jobs?’ Meanwhile, the wealth was going somewhere else. It wasn’t building in York.”

Along with the commercial exodus came an exodus of residents. York’s population declined by almost a third from 1950 to 2000. It has since inched back up as families pushed out by rising rents in New York and Philadelphia, or those fleeing crime in Baltimore, have landed in the city. But with unemployment approaching 9 percent, York is now a place with epidemic levels of poverty. More than one-third of the city’s residents live in poverty, a higher rate than in Baltimore or Philadelphia and twice the poverty rate in New York City.

Nonetheless, Helfrich has high hopes that a new federal incentive package might bring business back to York. So-called opportunity zones, an incentive with bipartisan support, were included in the 2017 federal tax law to lure capital from Wall Street to struggling cities and towns across the country. The Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a D.C. think tank launched by Sean Parker, the founder of Napster and former president of Facebook, worked for four years on the incentive, which is meant to fix a problem that has been evident to economists and mayors for years but has eluded a solution.

That problem worsened when the recession officially ended in mid-2009. The ensuing recovery was uneven. The economic expansion was led by a handful of urban hubs, the rock stars of the recovery. Austin, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and their surrounding metro areas were far outpacing most of the country in job growth. From 2010 to 2017, nearly half of the job growth occurred in the nation’s largest 20 metro areas. About half of the net increase in business establishments across the country from 2007 to 2016 took place in either D.C. or New York City. A generation ago, the opposite was the case. Job growth in the 1990s was led by rural and suburban counties, not urban centers. What the post-recession economy has favored -- an educated workforce, density and an established startup culture -- has left places like York far behind. “The rising tide,” says John Lettieri, president and CEO of EIG, “isn’t lifting all the boats.”

Lettieri, Parker and their colleagues created a blueprint they hoped would help even out jobs and wealth creation across the country. Investors had gotten fat on Wall Street bets. Much of their newfound money was sitting idle. If those funds could be shielded from capital gains, EIG theorized, they could be moved off Wall Street and invested in new ventures in other places.

Their idea was to allow investors to reduce their capital gains exposure in exchange for investment in certain low-income Census tracts to be designated as opportunity zones. For a place to qualify as an opportunity zone, at least 20 percent of its residents have to live in poverty, or the earnings of the residents have to be below 80 percent of the area’s median income. In return for their money, investors would be able to reduce the capital gains tax liability on their investment by 10 percent if they left their money in the zone for five years. If they didn’t move the money for seven years, they would receive a 15 percent reduction in capital gains taxes. If they kept it there 10 years, they would receive a 15 percent reduction in capital gains taxes and escape any liability on gains that came from investment in the zone. Congress bought into the idea. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin estimated that $100 billion in capital would move off Wall Street as a result of the program.

Governors were allowed to mark 25 percent of the qualifying Census tracts in their states as opportunity zones. In June, the Treasury Department certified more than 8,700 zones across the United States and Puerto Rico. The exact rules are still being set, but investors needed to have their money in the opportunity zone funds by Dec. 31 to take full advantage of the benefit.

Helfrich pounced on the chance to leverage the tax incentives in opportunity zones, hoping they would be enough to overcome the high taxes in the city. He worked closely with Gov. Tom Wolf, himself a York native, to designate five city Census tracts as opportunity zones. As the deadline approached in December, only a handful of investors showed interest in York’s opportunity zones, and most of those weren’t large private equity firms from outside the city, but local investors.

York’s problem attracting outside investment to its opportunity zones has been even more frustrating considering where capital was moving. An opportunity zone fund targeting Chicago raised $105 million in 17 hours in November. When Amazon announced it had picked Long Island City, in the New York borough of Queens, as one of two sites to host the company’s second headquarters, investment sprinted to the opportunity zone that would be adjacent to the tech giant. Goldman Sachs, for example, announced it was putting $83 million into a real estate deal nearby. (Now that Amazon has announced it will no longer locate to New York, it's not yet clear what the impact on investments will be.)

Like York, Long Island City was once an industrial hub. The red neon Pepsi-Cola sign on the banks of the East River lit up the front of a bottling plant that churned out thousands of sodas each day. In the 1920s, the boom from industry lured the Bank of Manhattan to build a tower in Long Island City at the foot of the newly constructed Queensboro Bridge. When the bank opened in 1927, it was the tallest building in the borough, a title it would hold for 63 years. The surrounding square near the foot of the cantilever bridge was dubbed the Times Square of Queens.

Long Island City’s fortunes turned, just as they did in York. The bottling plant closed in 1999. The Bank of Manhattan branch was abandoned. The hands on the tower clock stopped ticking. And the slow and steady economic decline took its toll on the residents. As the factories emptied out, the demographics of the surrounding neighborhood shifted. The neighboring housing project went from a mix of white and black working-class people to largely poor residents, according to New York City’s own estimates, and almost exclusively black and Latino.

But unlike York, Long Island City has recovered in the last decade. With Manhattan and Brooklyn rents choking the wallets of the city’s young professionals, it has become one of the hottest places in the city for renters, especially affluent white renters. From 2010 to 2015, Long Island City was tied for first place among neighborhoods in New York in its influx of white residents. Median home prices went up 51 percent in the last six years. And rents in the neighborhood are the highest in Queens, according to the real estate firm Zillow.

Stil, poverty persists in Long Island City, especially in the housing projects, and the area was certified as an opportunity zone in June. The designation allowed Goldman Sachs to cash in on its real estate deal. “If you look at the behavior of the real estate industry,” says Timothy Weaver, an urban policy assistant professor at the University at Albany, “it is amassing vast amounts of money and directing money to take advantage of the policy.” To critics, opportunity zones are threatening to bestow huge grants on communities that don’t really need them.



Once an old factory warehouse, this building in York now houses apartments.

Opportunity zones are the latest in a long series of efforts by the federal government to direct investment to impoverished areas. Since the New Deal, the government has been trying to jumpstart economic growth in portions of the country where the economy was faltering. In the 1970s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development launched Community Development Block Grants and Urban Development Action Grants to revive struggling cities. Those programs were popular with the progressive administrations and congresses that dominated federal politics during that period.

Also in the 1970s, Republicans, led by U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, began proposing market-driven solutions to the same problems, referring to them most often as enterprise zones. Nearly all of these solutions were based on tax incentives or the loosening of economic regulations. Slightly different versions, under different names, were created and enacted by Democrats in the Clinton and Obama years. But the percentage of Americans living in poverty remained nearly unmoved through all the decades. Equally troubling was the increase in those living in extreme poverty. The number of Americans whose earnings equal less than 50 percent of the federal poverty line has more than doubled in the last 40 years, according to the Census.

Opportunity zones borrows a bit from the playbooks of the previous plans. But there are some significant changes. The market-driven solutions of the last 40 years have been in line with conservative supply-side economic policies. Investment, goes the theory, drives the economy. Cut taxes and investors will use their capital to make more money and, in turn, create jobs. Democrats in the 1980s and 1990s were largely skeptical of supply-side economics. The party insisted that market-driven programs include local hiring and local contracting provisions to make sure jobs were created in the community and the gains made by investors were shared with local businesses. For example, the empowerment zones that were established under the Clinton administration gave businesses a tax credit for hiring employees who lived in the zones. No such provisions exist in the opportunity zone program, despite backing from some prominent Democrats. Urban policy analysts see the program as an unbridled supply-side program. “It’s almost a purer version of the original vision,” Weaver says. “What happened with the empowerment zones and the enterprise zones is that Congress made compromises that watered them down.”

While companies aren’t required to hire a certain number of local employees, firms must have 70 percent of their tangible assets (property, materials and goods for sale) within the zone, a regulation designed to keep large retailers such as Amazon and Walmart from cashing in on the tax break. Even so, critics still characterize the program as too wide and unrestricted, noting that hot markets such as Chicago, Los Angeles and New York have already shown the most visible successes. Even their poorer neighborhoods are seen as better bets. That’s why Long Island City, not York, Pa., is attracting so much investment. And what critics fear is that the feverish investment in hot markets will lead to displacement of low-income residents. “If these investments are going to be luxury hotels and real estate investments it’s not going to help low-income people,” says Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. “It’s more likely to displace them.”

When EIG designed opportunity zones, the drafters expected that real estate would be -- and in their estimate, should be -- the first place for investors in the zones to put their money. Businesses would need offices, and workers would need housing. Gentrification was a concern, so the program included a condition that a developer buying a piece of real estate must make an equal investment in improving the property. If developers paid $1 million for a property in a city, they were required to make $1 million in improvements.

However, in the rules released by the IRS in October, the value of the land was taken out of the calculation for necessary improvements on a property. So only the structure, if there is one, will be factored into the amount of improvement necessary to qualify under the program. In York, Helfrich is worried that investors might see his city as a place to buy up real estate and not invest in businesses. Developers have long been buying factories in the city and converting them to condominiums and loft apartments. “We are very aware of the potential pitfalls of this program,” Helfrich says. “Our city wants to attract job-providing businesses and discourage those who want to gentrify the neighborhoods in our city.”



Mayor Michael Helrich, left, has embraced opportunity zones, thinking the tax breaks under the program will be enough to overcome York's high taxes.

Despite the market-driven underpinnings behind opportunity zones, libertarian-leaning conservatives are critical of the plan. For one thing, they insist, allowing governors to pick the areas of investment politicizes the program. The original zone map proposed for York included residential neighborhoods. But a lobbying effort by elected officials convinced the governor to move the zones to commercial areas where city leaders wanted the investment to go.

Another concern is that by lumping cities like Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C., with places such as Akron, Ohio; Clarksdale, Miss.; and York, the program is only encouraging more investment in superstar cities. “If you look in Los Angeles and New York City, many of the places that are labeled opportunity zones are places where investment is already happening,” says Weaver, the urban policy professor. “And investors are going to get tax breaks on investments that were going to happen anyway.”

Not only are the zones in the less attractive markets forced to compete with places such as Long Island City for investment, but the smaller markets are also competing with each other. “There are more than 8,000 Census tracts with the same tax advantage,” says Brett Theodos of the Urban Institute. It’ll be hard for these eager supplicants to distinguish themselves from one another. It would be simpler, he says, to play it safe and invest in Chicago, New York or Seattle.

Then there’s the issue of the Treasury Department rules. One of them states that 50 percent of the gross income generated by a business in a qualified opportunity zone must result from sales made within the zone. That would essentially disqualify all but retail and real estate investment. Lettieri of EIG has been critical of the 50 percent gross revenue rule, saying that if it remains in effect, opportunity zones will fail to spur the kind of economic activity that can revive the areas the program was designed to serve. “The No. 1 outcome we should be driving for here is to support new businesses,” Lettieri says. “The gross income rule is damaging to businesses unless you are a laundromat or hardware store who doesn’t sell anything online.”

The public comment period for the Treasury rules closed Dec. 14. EIG submitted comments in opposition to the 50 percent rule, but as of publication, it was still in the tax code.

The combined result of all this is that Helfrich is fielding only a handful of calls from outside investors. Still, there is some interest. John McElligott is the founder and CEO of York Exponential, a robotics firm that programs, designs and constructs its robots in York. On the day Governing visited the robotics plants, McElligott was set to meet with angel investors about the company’s expansion. McElligott wants to construct a $136 million robotics campus on a parcel of land called the Northwest Triangle. Gov. Wolf gave the company $6 million toward the project, but York Exponential is looking to investors for the rest of the capital to create what the CEO believes will transform York into a tech hub for hardware and manufacturing. “We are not going to be a research and development community,” McElligott says. “York is going to be less Facebook and more Ford.”

The campus, McElligott hopes, will be the tipping point in York’s renaissance. Once the new facility is operating, he believes other firms will come to York to compete either in building robots or building the materials to support his businesses’ growth. As the opportunity zone program was being developed, McElligott traveled to Washington, D.C., at least once a month to lobby on behalf of York’s interest.

The proposed York Exponential campus won’t die if the 50 percent gross revenue rule remains in place. McElligott is confident his investors will stick with his vision whether or not they reap the benefits of a tax break. But that might not be the case for the tech firms Helfrich and McElligott would like to see orbiting the campus when it is complete. “The program under the 50 percent rule encourages you to create a pizza shop,” McElligott says. “We are trying to create jobs.” McElligott and Helfrich want what they describe as middle-income jobs, not retail or restaurant employment. In 2017, retail paid an average of $14 an hour, or roughly $30,000 a year, if the employee worked 40 hours a week and received paid leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Even if the Treasury Department removes the 50 percent rule, investors will need some handholding if they are to see places such as York as genuinely appealing targets. None will want to lose the gains made on Wall Street in a risky business proposition. “Naturally the capital in this program is going to flow to real estate,” says Steve Waters, founder and CEO of SMB Intelligence, a firm that provides local government with data and information on how to grow their small business sectors. “It’s only going to flow to businesses if it’s directed.”

Many potential investors are looking to the Treasury right now to finalize the rules governing the program. “Investors are champing at the bit to invest in opportunity zones,” says Rebecca Mitich, a partner with Husch Blackwell, a law firm that specializes in using tax credits to develop real estate. “There are huge New York private equity funds and giant fund managers who are ready to go but still want additional guidance to proceed.

Lettieri believes the rules for the program are not set in stone. He and others expect more rules, perhaps a revision of the 50 percent gross revenue rule, to come in the spring. And even as the real estate activity around opportunity zones has been red hot, at what appears to be the expense of commercial business applicants, Lettieri and other backers of the opportunity zone idea believe business capital will begin to come off the sideline in 2019 as the program is better defined. If that doesn’t happen and the zones remain largely a benefit for real estate development, their creators believe they won’t reinvigorate communities like York. “Real estate is the floor, not the ceiling,” Lettieri says. “If the road ends with real estate, that is a big shortcoming.”",0,0,0,http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-federal-empowerment-zones.html

One issue that may crop up this election season is Trump’s Opportunity Zones.

Well, they aren’t Trump’s, really, but they were in the president’s giant tax reform bill. The zones were concocted by some high tech moguls and then slipped in to the tax reform legislation by Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.

Under the law, governors can designate a limited number of “distressed” areas. Those who invest in these “opportunity zones” then get preferential tax treatment on capital gains. The whole deal is to cost $1.5 billion.

If this all sounds vaguely familiar, it should. Some variation of a scheme aimed at revitalizing depressed places is offered with each new administration. There were Enterprise Zones and Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in the 1990s and 2000s. Before those, we had the Housing Act of 1949 and the Model Cities Program of the 1960s. Lots of money has gone into these things in both rural and urban communities — and not a lot has come out.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in 2016 noted that studies of empowerment zone programs have “found mixed effects.” Some show benefits, but that may be just because economic activity was shifted from one poor place to another. All in all, it’s a mixed bag.

Annie Lowery reviews Trump’s version in The Atlantic. She skips the wealth of information on previous incarnations of these kinds of programs but makes points worth remembering.

First, the Trump Opportunity Zones are essentially market driven. After the governors designate their zones, private capital makes all the decisions. In the Empowerment Zone program, communities had to create a plan. This time, it’s all up to business.

Second, she quotes economist Tim Bartik, who suggests a wiser use of money would be for government to do its job. “You can bulldoze your way through with subsidies or you can actually try to address the problems these communities have,” Bartik said.

What a concept!

**

A conference committee in the U.S. Congress is trying to decide whether there should be more strict requirements on those who receive food stamps. The House wants more people who get the benefit to work. The Senate doesn’t.

How does this issue affect urban and rural food stamp beneficiaries? The University of New Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy says there is no rural/urban difference.

Under the law proposed by the House, about 16 percent of those receiving food stamps in both rural and urban communities will be subject to the new work requirements, according to Carsey’s analysis.

Political scientist Samuel Abrams urges everyone to refrain from overstating the “urban-rural divide.” He writes:

“At first glance, the “urban-rural” divide seems reasonable. But the data don’t support this geographic line of thinking; opinion polls regarding President Trump and his values reveal widespread dislike for his worldview, and the notion that rural areas epitomize and are embracing his policies accordingly is false.”

We should note here that Abrams falls on one side of a battle among political scientists. He is of the persuasion that the whole notion of a partisan divide among regular folks is overblown. Most people, Abrams would contend, fall near the center.

Here, Abrams goes through all the polls showing that, yes, a higher percentage of people in rural areas like Trump or think he shares their values. But it is nowhere close to a majority, let alone a landslide.

Trade is a big deal in the politics of farm states. Here is a take on the issue by the Minot (North Dakota) Daily News editorial page:

After almost a decade when “Red” states or “flyover country” were all but overlooked, minimized, or outright derided, it has been a relief to see the important North Dakota and other agricultural states on the front burner again in the Trump administration.

That’s not random of course, nor does it have to do with a president who openly represents the best nature of rural America. Instead, it is a result of a coalition of the disaffected, the ignored and the insulted supporting a president who re-set the national view on agriculture, energy and traditional rural sensibilities.

That’s why Trump’s gambit with trade and tariffs might be his riskiest move to date – and that’s saying something. If Trump fails on this front, ag states are likely to soon turn their backs on the president, costing him support he cannot afford to lose headed into the midterms and then his re-election campaign in 2020.",2018,08,08,https://www.dailyyonder.com/fast-takes-latest-clone-empowerment-zone/2018/08/08/26994/
wftv,Orange County allocates $20 million for 'empowerment zones',"0 Orange County allocates $20 million for 'empowerment zones'

ORLANDO, Fla. - Operation Reachback works with young men in Orlando who don’t have a father figure in their lives.

“We found that there were so many,” said Jacquelyn Ross, who works for the program.

Several organizations, like Operation Reachback, are trying to keep Orange County kids out of trouble and on the right path to future success.

""We taught them health and wellness, we taught them how to drive, we taught them how to tie a tie. I mean so many things you take for granted -- these boys, they never sat behind the wheel of a car,” said Ross.

Last year, Orange County hired a consulting firm to find gaps in child services where more money could help.

In November, Channel 9 obtained the firm’s findings and reported the county would be funneling its newly allocated $20 million into nine of the more 50 zip codes in the county.

""We now have the locations where we can have the greatest impact here in Orange County,” said Mayor Jerry Demings.

Here's a map of those nine zip codes:

Areas the county’s calling “empowerment zones” -- with the highest levels of poverty, juvenile arrests, dependency issues, abuse or neglect, teen pregnancies and infant mortality.

Nearly 700 kids a year are arrested in Pine Hills.

Organizations like Operation Reachback, which are helping disadvantaged kids get into college, said with a share of that money, they can do a lot.

""One of those young men never had a bed to sleep in. And when he went to college, he had his own room. So, he's continuing to grow,” said Lesli Ahonkhai, who works for the program.

news24,"FF+ manifesto calls for smaller Cabinet, AA-free economic zones, community councils","The Freedom Front Plus proposed privatising state entities, reducing Cabinet to 16 ministers, not letting the government go over budget, and opening affirmative action-free economic zones in its election manifesto which was launched in Pretoria on Saturday.

The party also reiterated its opposition to expropriation of land without compensation in favour of redistributing unused state-owned land and failed land reform projects, and speeding up land claims.

Led by MP Pieter Groenwald, the party's manifesto said it would protect heritage, conservation and social care under community councils, and schools and other institutions can choose if they want to be part of a community council system, or fall directly under the government.

It wants to do away with race-based affirmative action, in favour of a merit-based system.

The party also wants to reduce salary increases and bonuses to public office bearers and increase VAT if government spending reaches a pre-set cap then reduce it once spending is under control again.

It wants municipalities to comprise of a single town, instead of the current mega-municipalities which are struggling, and believes local government and provincial governments should have more power.

It also submits that self-determination to recognise diversity is becoming accepted world-wide and should be introduced in South Africa.

READ: Peter Marais says he is back to fight for Afrikaans, self-determination and for Christian values

It wants personal and company tax lowered to stimulate investment in the economy and create jobs, and to decrease the fuel levy significantly.

The Road Accident Fund must be done away with and every motor vehicle owner must be compelled by legislation to take out third-party insurance. It is also calling for aboloshing e-tolls in Gauteng.

The party wants the policing and prosecution of violence against women and children to be prioritised and an increase in state funding of non-profit organisations, like children's homes and homes for the elderly and disabled people.

It will abolish transformation targets and black economic empowerment to encourage the private sector to appoint the best person for the job, to promote economic growth.

Strikes and particularly illegal strikes that lead to job losses must be prohibited, there should be no protests near schools, and trade unions' power must be restricted.

The party also proposes that teachers who are willing to work at less affluent schools must receive higher remuneration and higher bonuses, and proposes a system of parent- and community-driven mother-tongue education, expressing concern about the anglicising of education in South Africa.

The FF Plus supports greater state expenditure on agricultural research and protection against international dumping. It says it is in support of private property rights and food security, and believes that if there is expropriation, it must be market-related and should go through a court.

gainesville,Input sought on empowerment zone,"A proposal to create a community empowerment zone to help children and families in northeast Gainesville improve their quality of life will be unveiled Oct. 13.

Modeled after the Harlem Children’s Zone in New York City, which has received national attention for reducing inter-generational poverty, the zone will be a partnership between residents, businesses, civic and social agencies, local government and schools.

The proposal is an initiative of GNV4ALL, a cross-section of community leaders and residents brought together by The Gainesville Sun two years ago to address racial disparities, inequities and injustices in Alachua County.

The Gainesville Empowerment Zone will be introduced to residents, especially those who live near Howard Bishop Middle School, at a 6 p.m. meeting at the Library Partnership, 912 NE 16th Ave.

“I believe with the help of the business community, faith community and education community that we can get this thing off the ground,” said James Lawrence, executive director of GNV4ALL, at a meeting last week at Eastside High School to update the community about recommendations made earlier this year by the various GNV4ALL committees.

Close to 100 people attended and heard the reports on criminal justice, education, health and transportation, housing, jobs and families.

The presentation about what the criminal justice committee has accomplished was given by Sgt. Paul Pardue, racial and ethnic disparity and disproportionate minority contact coordinator with the Youth and Community Resource Unit at the Alachua County Sheriff's Office.

One of the highlights from the criminal justice committee is that both the Sheriff's Office and Gainesville Police Department have established policies not to charge children 12 and younger with criminal offenses.

Also, all sheriff's deputies have taken implicit bias training and all new deputies take the same training, and GPD is conducting similar training, Pardue said. The training is designed to counter hidden prejudices that can affect responses by law enforcement officers, judges and others. Similar training is under way for teachers, school administrators and others across the city.

A program allowing people arrested for minor offenses to be released from jail before first appearance has been in effect since May after Judge Toby Manaco, chief judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, signed an order enacting the policy that has resulted in the pre-trial release of 45 so far, said Stacy Scott, public defender for the Eighth Judicial Circuit.

“This is a huge success and a great step in the right direction,” Scott said.

Supporters of the program say it allows people to get back to work to earn a living and not be stuck in jail for longer than necessary.

The deferred prosecution agreement, a program established by Eighth Judicial Circuit State Attorney Bill Cervone, is another program in place that was advocated for by the criminal justice committee. It allows offenders to pay a nominal fine and/or perform community service hours instead of being formally charged with a crime, Scott said.

The housing committee report was given by Gary Hankins, who was just appointed as leader of the committee the day before. He announced a partnership with the United Way of North Central Florida that will include the United Way providing office space, equipment and staff support in the committee’s fundraising efforts to build up a community land trust program that has been established to help provide more affordable housing in Alachua County.

Also, the housing committee has formed a partnership with the University of Florida Conservation Clinic in the Levin College of Law to educate property owners in retaining homes as they are inherited from one generation to the next.

The committee is also working with the city of High Springs’ Community Redevelopment Agency to revitalize the historically black Douglass neighborhood in the city, Hankins said.

The health and transportation committee leader Wendy Resnick reported that the committee has been working on health issues that include a campaign to have city and county officials raise the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21, and encouraging Gainesville to make some of its parks smoke-free zones; addressing mental health issues and sparking Alachua County government and several local law enforcement agencies to provide mental health first aid training to their employees; addressing the need for poor people to have access to dental care and promoting education and prevention programs that focus on childhood obesity.

The education committee report was given by Nathan Crabbe, The Sun’s editorial page editor, newly-elected School Board member Tina Certain and School Board member Leanetta McNealy. Each of them talked about the importance of closing the achievement gap between black and white students in Alachua County public schools, with McNealy emphasizing the need for more diversity in the district’s administrative and instructional workforce.

The jobs and families committee report was given by Lawrence, and he talked about efforts to improve vocational and technical training opportunities for young people in Alachua County and the establishment of the Gainesville Empowerment Zone.

The area around Howard Bishop Middle School was identified as the best place for the zone because of the services already being delivered at the school, and to help students who are performing poorly in school and whose families are struggling to make ends meet, Lawrence said.

“The empowerment zone will focus on providing wrap-around services for kids and families,” Lawrence said. “The thought is that if we can help kids at Rawlings and Metcalf Elementary schools be better prepared when they feed into Howard Bishop, they will have a better chance of being successful when they get to high school and beyond.”",2018,09,07,https://www.gainesville.com/news/20180907/input-sought-on-empowerment-zone

Nari Ward has witnessed his neighbourhood transform. Harlem, once neglected and teeming with creative energy but rampant with drugs, crime, and wreckage, has become home to organic groceries, high-end cafés, and high-income housing. It is a symptom of many gentrifying neighbourhoods in New York, whereby high-earning populations replace lower-income inhabitants. Ward has been making art and collecting the material history of a now-extinct backdrop for 25 years, working in his studio on 141st street, which was first a fire station, then a piano moving company, then the site of a limousine service.

His practice since the 1990s, when he was a young graduate from Hunter College and later Brooklyn College where he earned his MFA, has been based in found objects. He confounds these objects, extending and bringing to light their materiality, combining them by welding, burning, or binding them with rope, sugar, or soda, or sometimes just placing them inside one another in a found picture or grandfather clock. Ward's assemblages and installations are often tactile, striated with layers of history, and charged with the grit of a survivalist nature, while others are humorous, poetic, and tender.

Ward's solo exhibition, We the People, at the New Museum (13 February–26 May 2019), surveys 25 years of the artist's work: sculptures, large-scale installations, paintings, and videos created between 1992 and 2019. A large portion of the works are from the 1990s, a statement in itself, since the issues of that period—poverty, race, consumer, and material culture—still resonate today. The artist was initially inspired to title the show 'Hunger Cradle' after a 1996 work of that name: a giant web of yarn, rope, and found materials—such as piano keys, books, car parts, and hand tools—woven within. Ward made the installation at the former fire station in Harlem that would become his studio, for a show he co-organised in 1996 with his friends and fellow artists Janine Antoni and Marcel Odenbach titled 3 Legged Race. The consuming installation embodies the sites where it is shown; as he describes in conversation, the piece both devours and protects the physical remnants of these places, somewhat a metaphor for his artistic process. At the New Museum, Hunger Cradle includes remains from the building adjacent to the museum, which it acquired; a tangle of discarded objects and frozen moments piled into one another

Ward's exhibition is a display of lived experiences and exchanges with individuals otherwise exploited and neglected by power. Amazing Grace (1993) consists of over 250 dilapidated baby strollers that Ward found abandoned on the streets, arranged around an aisle of flattened fire hoses that provide an unsteady ground to walk on. The voice of influential gospel singer Mahalia Jackson performing the hymn 'Amazing Grace' accompanies viewers as they consider the lives these strollers once had, whether they cradled children or were repurposed by the homeless to haul possessions. As a whole, Amazing Grace is a memorial to New York of the early 1990s, drawing in the state of Harlem and the devastation caused by the drugs and AIDS epidemics, while reaching back to histories of colonialism and slavery, with the hoses arranged on the floor echoing the hull of a ghost ship.

Monuments and memorials appear throughout Ward's show. Made from an iron fence overgrown with dilapidated textiles that have been caramelised to look like entrails, Sky Juice (1993) references a Jamaican drink sold by street vendors and made of ice, syrup, and water, poured in a bag and consumed with a straw. Standing on cement blocks, the fence holds a shredded sun umbrella with dangling mutilated plastic bottles filled with found photographs. The clumped textiles in the fence are coated in sugar and Tropical Fantasy soda, a soft drink originally founded in Brooklyn in 1990 that gained popularity in the poorer neighbourhoods for its 0.49 cent bottles. A rumour spread in 1991 that the company producing Tropical Fantasy Soda was lacing the soft drink with an agent that could sterilise black men. It took the city's (black) mayor at the time, David N. Dinkins, to drink a bottle on television to avert further panic.

In this conversation, Ward talks about his works from the 1990s and 2000s, reflecting on ideas and forms of power and how making work during that time feels very different to how he makes work today.

You mix very distinct cultural experiences in your work, related to, for instance, urban and civilian institutions—like the corner shop—or institutions of power, like the police or a financial bank. How do you approach and subvert the codes, languages, and signs that you bring to life in your work?

These are all kinds of street power symbols. The role that I'm trying to play is about creating doubt, because these logos are all about affirming a kind of label that is supposed to be in some ways unmatched—this is what it stands for, what it encompasses. So, it's really about fracturing that perspective and thinking about all the possible grey areas that other content and narratives can occupy.

For instance, this new work that I am currently making—a take on the copper panel works, 'Breathing Panels', which I had done in 2015. I'm looking at history and figuring out the many unrepresented voices in history and how history is always evolving. To talk about that evolution isn't about showing more history, but it's to sort of hold history down and maybe even contain it. So the whole emphasis of this idea, which is tied into what you're asking, is this sense of stopping a moment, but within that moment it is not about revealing all the possible moments within it as it is about highlighting what's in it. History tells a particular story, and I'm trying to say: 'Yeah there is a particular story, but there are many stories that aren't visible within that one created narrative.' I think that it's about bringing mystery into the conversation more so than facts. So the whole idea is bringing this marker, image, or form to the forefront, but at the same time destabilising it so that it acts as a placeholder for other possibilities or somebody else's narrative.

Could you tell me more about the 'Breathing Circles' series (2018)?

These are done in copper and they're referencing this African [Congolese] cosmogram that represents birth, life, death, and rebirth. They also served as breathing holes for runaway slaves, who hid under the floorboards at a church on the Underground Railroad: this old church is a very important site—the First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia. The whole idea for me when I saw it—the magic and power of this site and these patterned holes on the floor—was that these enslaved individuals were trying to preserve their history in this very important way of resistance, which is this coded breathing hole pattern on the floor that served as a space for the basement's ventilation. In the daytime, the slaves would hide under there and at night they would go North. For me, it was really a powerful thing that was preserved and used in a radical way. I like this idea that the holes were visible and also invisible at the same time.

My challenge was that it was a really good story, but how do I make it present? What I did with the copper panels is that I started walking on top of them to bring the body back into the space. This became a series of works that had to do with the landscape and directions. I wanted to have this series deal with this idea of American history, specifically.

This idea of relating to history is linked to issues of what is visible and invisible, and what one can understand or grasp from different human experiences; but it is also connected with what one cannot fathom or understand, or what is totally opaque.

And that's another way to talk about another possibility, because I think the idea of being opaque is the idea of deciding not to capitulate to the norm, because you don't necessarily need to be part of that canon—being outside of it is quite okay, and trying to be inside of it in some way dilutes your position. You fight for your own space, not to join that space. So in fighting for your own space, that means that you may need to reject that other thing. Opacity as a way of rejecting clarity, which is the history that is known—for me, that resonates.

Can we talk about your use of animals, such as the fox and the goat, in your work? They belong to the world of fables and mythological creatures, but they also have this pedestrian quality to them.

They're also about chance. They are not entirely controllable because they're nature. Joan Jonas always has her dog in her videos. I always thought that it makes sense, because as an artist you're always trying to have this control, but then you need to figure out how to bring in this space that you can't control. That is powerful. There's a level of opacity to that life that you're negotiating, but it's also powerful to bring it in as a presence to act and react against. For me, that's really exciting—to try to draw on the live animal and the expectation or imagination to what that animal might be. For instance, the show I did at Socrates Sculpture Park, G.O.A.T., again (29 April–4 September 2017), was very much a play on the moment. The goat was a metaphor for debauchery. A metaphor for male ego; male prowess. I made Bipartition Bell (2017)—this large goat scrotum that you could walk under—it was meant to look like a bell, but when you went in to use it, it made this tiny ding rather than this big chiming sound. It was all playing on expectations and destabilising those expectations into being much more about shortcomings.

There was also the piece Apollo/poll (2017), which I'm showing at the New Museum. It was the frame for the entire show at Socrates Sculpture Park, because it talked about consensus and at the same time entertainment. I was referencing the Apollo Theater's amateur night. I have never been to the Apollo Theater, but every Wednesday they have Amateur Night, and when you think of the Apollo Theater you think about all these stars that have gone through, but you can also think of the other side of it being all the people who want to be stars. I was trying to figure out how the blinking of the Apollo sign—having the word 'poll' in it—could work. Before the election, I wanted to have the sign blink 'Apollo' / 'pollo' [Spanish for chicken] because the show was in a Spanish neighbourhood, and I wanted to be playful—and it wasn't a goat but chickens that the work was going to reference. But when it went into the poll space, it became about power in a different way, and the chicken didn't work there. That work talked about the idea of belonging in some way.

Has the current political atmosphere in the U.S. made its way into your studio?

It does in different ways. I've had on my door, for years now, a little plastic plaque of Martin Luther King that the school in the neighbourhood had thrown out. I just had it on my door and for some reason within the last two years it sort of felt like an island. It was just an image of his head, and it made me want to bring King into the centre of the conversation again, just his presence. I was also recently listening to Cornel West talking about The Radical King (2015), and how King has been mainstreamed to being like Santa Claus in a way. But actually he was very misunderstood and, also in his own way, very conflicted in terms of the breadth of his political agenda. My desire is to re-look at his sacrifice and bring that back around for the time that we're in.

Your work is very formal and rooted in the exploration of materials. The found objects are also semantically coded—they bring in layers of meaning.

You know I came out of a drawing background. I'm a formalist. Sculpture didn't come to me until the end of grad school with my thesis show, which was an installation. But prior to that, I was doing drawings. It was more about the line or the rectangle or the square, balance and compositions, space and gesture. This and being haunted by the history of the medium kind of made me want to say: how do I think about this moment? I think that's when using found objects made most sense as it was so much about being in the present moment with the viewer. And also, it was a challenge to retell the narrative of the object in a way that a line wouldn't be able to convey.

This makes me think about the work Amazing Grace (1993). To me, the installation employs the readymade as a tie to a record—the marker of a social practice with a documentary component.

When I think of artists that work with found objects, such as The Heidelberg Project in Detroit, they're all reacting to some event—the breakdown of the urban environment or the rebellion of L.A.—and so they're from that residue. They're trying to reconstruct different narratives that happened. Because of the show, I've been reflecting a lot on the work I did in the nineties, and how I could never do it now because it was so much about the state of things at that moment. It really is kind of like you said: a documentary iteration of material.

The one material that was so ubiquitous and so dangerous that I did not touch because it was so charged was the crack vial. It was everywhere, almost like pebbles. Because it was such a devastating epidemic, I did not feel I could address it at the time. But I do think about those vials and what having collected them would mean today, as they were so much about what they represented in terms of loss, but also in terms of greed. There's a whole narrative that considers that this was a kind of expulsion to clear out the inner cities for what's happening now with gentrification, because immediately after this happened the government stepped in and created empowerment zones where they dictated who was going to develop these neighbourhoods. It was almost like dropping a bomb on these poor neighbourhoods and then going back in and reforming it, all within 20 years. It really makes you think about the other narrative that is not in the mainstream, and it still seems to somehow resonate today.

How has this aspect of social documentation evolved for you throughout the years?

I still walk around and react to things that I see, that I pick up on the street; but it's much more driven by the anxiety of the news—thinking about stuff and trying to figure out what I need and what's going to help tell the story. Now I can go on eBay and figure out how to get those things I'm thinking of. It's just a different way of engaging with ideas and materials; I can be as specific as I want when looking for a particular material.

There was a time, being a found object artist in a more overlooked urban space, that you would find things that would be on the street for two to three weeks. Now things disappear in the same week. You have to be quick now. All of the strollers [in Amazing Grace] were found. I was an artist in residence at the Studio Museum at the time, and for a good three to four months, I would just walk around. They weren't that hard to find. People were using them and would abandon them, or they were using them for bottles and cans. They would congregate in the empty lot and then go to the store and get their deposit.

You have been working in Harlem for a very long time, and have seen and experienced a lot. I am curious about how emergent themes of the nineties such as institutional critique and identity politics sit in your work. How has the discourse changed?

I think it was always the idea of fixating on otherness as being a fight—like I'm going to fight to declare my space—and I think there's much more an inquiry now as things have evolved from questioning what 'belonging' might mean. I think there is that double clarity of looking at the fiction of the system and discrediting it—the structure that has declared you as the other. At least my own evolution has come to that.

Now I see it as, 'Oh, there are a lot of lies and those lies have become institutionalised.' So, I think that woke moment is underlined by our current situation. The Obama moment made you think that it's all good, progress is happening; so I kind of chose to ignore the backsliding of history, and the indiscretions that happened. But I realise that those are not indiscretions; they're just a symptom of the lies that have been perpetuated from the very beginning. That realisation has kind of made me listen and have this double consciousness. I listen as a black person, as an artist, and as a human to try and negotiate my connected-ness beyond culture. I feel like that's where I'm at and where we are right now.

Can you tell me about Hunger Cradle (1996)?

Hunger Cradle was first shown here in my studio at a show called 3 Legged Race, with fellow artists and friends Janine Antoni and Marcel Odenbach. I took the second floor, Janine was on the top floor, and Marcel on this floor with a video projection. Basically, I collected elements from the life of the building. It's a building from 1916, a horse and buggy building. It then belonged to the fire department, and then it became a piano moving company, and then it became a limousine service. There were all these remnants of that history in the building. It was relatively clean but there was stuff in the basement, and I decided that I wanted to lift everything off the ground and basically weave it all together.

I had just come back from a Shaker residency and I did this bottle quilt project. It was really labour-intensive. I found these bottles that were from a dumpsite. They were all different kinds of bottles. The best way to weave them was to cover each one with yarn and tie them all together, so it was hours of work. I had this bottle curtain that I wanted to present, and I thought I could do this with other objects. So, the entire cradle—and cradle is a key word—talked about the idea of devouring but also protection; it is a correlation and opposition of those two things.

The piece was purchased, and in a moment of crisis it tested my artistic integrity. Does it make sense to sell this piece from this space in Harlem? What does it mean if it goes off to another place? I decided that it would function only if something is added to the work within every new context, so it almost absorbs another element of its own history. At the New Museum, there were different things I had to look at: two metal trusses that the museum uses to hang things from the ceiling, a super 8 film projector and parts of a paper copier, and also the old radiators that were there in the old building next door that's just been acquired by the museum.

Super Stud Salt Table (1995/2019) is a piece that was recreated for the show. Could you talk about it?

It is a cod fish table that has a display of book pages around it that I appropriated from a book about the collection of Robert Lehman—a collector with a wing at the Met. To acquire his collection, the Met had to recreate his house, so if you go into the Robert Lehman Wing you go into a recreation of his house. What a demonstration of power!

When I was able to appropriate the book from his collection, I decided I wanted to talk about power in my own way. The book is laid out with images of the collection and their provenance. I took out all the pages with the Madonna and Child and I made this piece called Super Stud (1995–2001). It was a metal house made out of metal studs and had the pages—from the book I had—framed around the walls of the house. The floor was covered in cod fish, so you had to walk on salted cod fish. It looks like you're walking on a granite floor, but when you look down you see the little fins. And the ceiling was made out of plantains. It was a full-on experience with the images of Christ inside.

Can you tell me more about the cod fish and the plantains?

Cod fish is something I really grew up with. Ackee and salt fish is Jamaica's national dish. So there's a personal component to it, but cod fish is also what allowed for European conquest of the so-called New World. Without the preserved fish, the Vikings wouldn't have been able to do their trans-Atlantic treks, so it was the staple that really allowed for the mind space to go out and conquer. And there is the relation to Aquarius, the fish, the symbol of Christ. So, there were all these pieces that were tied into the work. The plantains are just phallic. I thought they'd decay and get smelly and soft after painting them, but I coated them with a gel medium when they were green and so they hardened. They were kind of preserved.

Your works also preserve histories in a way that is both concealing and revealing.

Like Anchoring Escapement; Fang (2018): the grandfather clock that has the cosmogram pattern at the top, and two African statues are placed where the pendulum would be. They are on display but also sort of hiding. It is kind of replaying the narrative of the church. But also for me, what's exciting as a sculptor when thinking of the history of vitrines and how the sculptures contained within them refer to the ethnographic museum, is that it's a kind of vitrine that everyone is familiar with. It is an element of time with its pendulum missing and what replaces it is this other element of time in there instead. —[O]",2019,03,04,https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/nari-ward/
bostonglobe,Time for a reset on education funding,"State Senator Jason Lewis, the new Senate chairman, has a reputation as a thoughtful lawmaker willing to roll up his sleeves and delve deep into the details in search of well-tailored policy solutions.

Senate President Karen Spilka has opted for new Senate leadership on the Legislature’s joint Education Committee — and with a new Senate chair comes an opportunity for a more pragmatic approach on the complicated educational task ahead for policymakers this year.

State Senator Jason Lewis, the new Senate chairman, has a reputation as a thoughtful lawmaker willing to roll up his sleeves and delve deep into the details in search of well-tailored policy solutions. Such an approach should be helpful as the Legislature tries again to rework the formula by which the state distributes education dollars to cities and towns.

The previous Senate chair, Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz, herself a former public school teacher, worked passionately to elevate the issue of more equitable funding and has been a champion for urban kids. But she was more ardent advocate than pragmatic dealmaker. Last year’s effort broke down in acrimony at the 11th hour. This year’s effort has started unevenly. Everyone agrees that more money is needed, especially for poor urban communities. But that’s about where the agreement stops.

Well before the Senate’s new chairmen and chairwomen were announced, Chang-Diaz had tried to set the tone for the debate with legislation that proposed a large increase in funding, but nothing new by way of tools to catalyze change in underperforming schools.

Governor Charlie Baker has also proposed a substantial funding increase, but wants the state to have more tools to leverage change. Baker also favors school empowerment zones, an arrangement where a local and state board would closely oversee improvement efforts in struggling schools, an idea the House is also receptive to. But with the teachers unions and some other stakeholders rallying behind Chang-Diaz’s money-only approach, there was some risk that this year’s effort would result in another end-of-session train wreck.

With Lewis’s ascension to chairman, there’s an opportunity to recalibrate toward compromise. Lewis notes that he has a good relationship with state Representative Alice Peisch, the House Education chair, from his days serving in the House, and strikes a conciliatory tone toward Baker and Education Commissioner Jeff Riley, saying that the two are “very important stakeholders” in this conversation — and that he is pleased Baker has put forward a proposal of his own.

The new chairman feels strongly that the state’s timeworn funding formula no longer provides the resources necessary for some schools and students. That means the bargain struck by the state’s 1993 education reform law — the state will provide the funding necessary for a good education, and then hold the cities and towns responsible for delivering one — has broken down.

“We have steadily lost ground,” Lewis says. “We are not providing the resources.” Still, he adds that “if there are changes we need to make to our accountability system, I am open to looking at that.”

This could also be an opportunity for the Massachusetts Teachers Association to re-engage in a serious way. Once an influential player on Beacon Hill, the MTA has seen its inside-the-building clout diminish as it has elected leaders who too often frame state issues in a us-versus-enemies-of-public-education way. The union’s loss of pragmatic perspective is aptly illustrated by one recent incident: When Baker came out with his education proposal, the MTA charged that it “gives the state new weapons with which to force districts to implement changes against the wishes of the community.”

Lewis has good relations with the union. His ascension to the Senate’s Education Chairman is an opportunity for the MTA to reconsider its posture. If not, perhaps a group of teachers who don’t share MTA’s combative mentality could contribute some constructive ideas.

Fixing the state’s education funding formula is important. This is the year to get it done.",2019,02,16,https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2019/02/16/time-for-reset-education-funding/MouIMOaX5wUOTeZzcScVuJ/story.html
citylab,The Problem With Opportunity Zones,"Tax breaks to spur investment in cities like Camden, New Jersey, were meant to reduce poverty. So far, results have been underwhelming. Matt Rourke/AP

Will tax incentives really encourage investors to help revitalize low-income communities? Research on similar efforts from the past suggests otherwise.

The latest federal effort to revitalize impoverished parts of the country using tax incentives is beginning to take shape. Unfortunately, if history is a guide, it won’t work. New York, New Hampshire and Florida are among the latest states to nominate low-income neighborhoods for the new Opportunity Zone program, created as part of the tax law passed late last year. They hope to join the 18 states already in the program, which offers investors a big tax break in exchange for plowing money into areas designated as opportunity zones. The program’s backers claim this will reduce poverty, increase employment and spur growth. However, research conducted by myself and others shows that this approach tends to fail. An old approach At the heart of the Opportunity Zone program is the simple idea that tax incentives for investors will transform declining areas into thriving economic hubs. This is based on the faulty notion that urban or rural deterioration results from excessive taxation undermining capital investment.

Specifically, the program lets investors avoid the usual tax on capital gains by putting their profits into so-called opportunity funds, an incentive that lasts until 2026. At least 90 percent of the assets in such funds must be invested in designated low-income zones, which are based on statistical geographic subdivisions known as “census tracts.” Other incentives kick in if the investment is held for at least 10 years. This approach is nothing new. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher’s government first tested the idea by creating 11 “enterprise zones” in the U.K. that offered a range of tax breaks and regulatory relief. The most famous of these was in London’s dilapidated docks—including Canary Wharf—which soon after underwent a dramatic transformation and is now home to many of the country’s major financial institutions. These policies almost inevitably result in tax giveaways for investment that would have occurred anyway. Because it showcased the apparent virtues of the free market, the enterprise zone idea quickly crossed the Atlantic and attracted the interest of conservative politicians and thinkers in the United States, such as Brookings Institution policy analyst Stuart Butler—formerly of the Heritage Foundation—and then President Ronald Reagan. More than 40 U.S. states eventually created these zones, which offer a range of incentives, such as tax relief and job training. Although Democrats were generally skeptical at first, over time more became sympathetic to pro-market solutions to the problem of urban decay. The Clinton administration, for example, created a related program in 1994 that set up “empowerment zones.”

Both programs have since expired. Do they work? Numerous efforts have been made to assess the effectiveness of such zones, both in the U.S. and the U.K. On the whole, scholars have reached the strikingly similar conclusion that the programs did not work, at least not as hoped. In their exhaustive study of 75 enterprise zones in 13 states, Alan Peters and Peter Fisher, professors of urban and regional planning, found that the tax incentives had “little or no positive impact” on economic growth. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... In my own research on Philadelphia, I found that the effect of empowerment zones was negligible. The places inside the empowerment zone boundaries actually fared worse in terms of income and employment growth when compared with similar census tracts. They were only marginally better in terms of reducing poverty, which was still more than a third of the city’s households in 2007, over a decade into the program. Opportunity zone advocates, meanwhile, have pointed to states like New Jersey and Indiana as examples of success. However, one study suggested that increased economic activity in zones in New Jersey came at the expense of non-zone areas nearby, while an analysis of the Indiana program suggested that the incentives encouraged a switch to less-productive forms of economic activity. In the U.K., supporters of the enterprise zone program highlight the London Docklands, which went from a derelict port to a thriving financial services hub. Yet government studies showed that relatively few jobs were created and that each one cost US$35,000 to $45,000 in spending and lost revenue. And my own research shows that despite these gains the area is still home to some of the most “income deprived households” in the U.K. The government’s recent effort to revive the program created 29,000 jobs as of 2017, just half the number it promised, at a cost of about $3 billion. Helping the poor Despite the lackluster performance of the tax incentive approach in terms of job creation and poverty reduction, the idea continues to attract support on both sides of the Atlantic and across the political divide.

Sadly, these policies almost inevitably result in tax giveaways for investment that would have occurred anyway, as we’re beginning to see with opportunity zones. Under such circumstances, displacement from gentrification is the likely result.

For example, in Louisville, Kentucky, the central business district and the fast-gentrifying tracts of Nulu, Butchertown, and Portland were deemed opportunity zones despite having already seen major capital investment in recent years, yet seven of the 18 poorest tracts were not. We see the same pattern in New York where places like Sunset Park, Brooklyn, have been targeted despite having already attracted substantial private investment. The New York Times even identified Sunset Park as one of the city’s “hot new neighborhoods.” So what might work to revitalize poor neighborhoods and help the 40.6 million Americans in poverty? While there’s no panacea, I argue policies that enhance what I call urban social citizenship and empower people to invest in their communities would be far more successful than tax breaks for investors.

San Diego is the newest Military Spouse Empowerment Zone under a national program that seeks to end the high rate of unemployment among the partners of America’s active-duty military.

with a small monthly contribution Become a supporter

“We have to employ military spouses — they are a vital resource,” said Elizabeth O’Brien, senior director of Hiring Our Heroes, a program of the U.S Chamber of Commerce Foundation.

Spouses face the hardship of not just being alone during an extended deployment but an unemployment rate that is four times higher than the general population.

San Diego, which is home to 110,000 active-duty personnel, became the latest city to join the program as the city government and San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce announced Tuesday their involvement.

“The San Diego Regional Chamber recognizes that military spouses face unique challenges in securing employment while their partners are serving our country,” said Jerry Sanders, president and CEO of the chamber. “This is why we proudly partner with Hiring Our Heroes and remain dedicated to creating opportunities for our regional business community to tap into this talented, committed and valuable workforce and help our region’s military spouses find a meaningful career.”

Established to connect military spouses with companies committed to hiring, the zones are collaborative efforts among business, civic and military communities to build employment networks in municipalities around the country. The first was launched in San Antonio in February.

“Hiring Our Heroes is proud to welcome the city of San Diego into a growing network of communities working to provide local solutions to barriers to entry for military spouse employment,” said Eric Eversole, president of Hiring Our Heroes and vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

bigcountryhomepage,Neighborhood empowerment zone created to spur inward growth in Abilene,"Neighborhood empowerment zone created to spur inward growth in Abilene Video

ABILENE, Texas (KTAB) - Cities working to bring in business is nothing new, but the City of Abilene is taking steps to bring that development to specific areas. A ""neighborhood empowerment zone"" stretches from Interstate 20 to South 14th Street, and from Old Anson Road to Treadaway on its west and east boundaries. This zone is an effort to make the city grow in, instead of out, using older buildings to revitalize older areas.

Infill development is the name of the game, which means that businesses or home builders don't necessarily need to use an existing structure in every case. The goal is to bring new businesses, homes and activity to areas of town which have started to ""slump"". Sometimes that means rehabilitating an old structure, and sometimes it means using space that was vacant or abandoned to build something new.

It's not only business that the City is after. Assistant City Manager Michael Rice explains: ""It really doesn't matter what type of development it is. It could be residential in nature, it could be commercial in nature. Once again, it's just whoever has a vision to go in and look at this target area, and try to find projects that actually qualify, and help with the overall appearance of all of Abilene.""

Working in the zone equates to more than just a tax break. There are other incentives in place to encourage development. ""Things such as waiving the fees for building inspections, building plans, things of that nature"", explains Rice.

Rice adds that there is already activity spurring from the change: ""The one that was just approved is actually one where we participated in some of the infrastructure improvements, that will not only improve that existing development, but also provide additional support for the community around it.""

The Abilene Chamber of Commerce takes a similar stance on bringing activity back to the core of town, especially when it comes to residential development.

""That's going to attract additional retail, because retail looks for rooftops, and where they can find that density, and the right demographics within that density, that's where they choose to go"", says Chamber President Doug Peters. ""We're already seeing a lot of that happening, right here in Abilene.""

Even thought it's outside the zone, Texas Family Popcorn on South 14th Street is an example of infill development. They were able to rework an existing structure, a car wash, and make the storefront they wanted. Owner Toni McAdams says that she'd always rather use an old building, to help the city and remove an eyesore. ""I'm all about renovating a place"", she says, ""using what we already have, repurposing. I'm not a 'save the Earth' kind of person, but I'm definitely somebody who wants to use what we have.""

The official push to foster development in the empowerment zone is similar to a plan already tried in 2009. Rice admits that it didn't meet with much success, but says that this new plan is already more successful, as evidenced by the developers already in talks with the City after only a month of the zone's existence.",2018,07,17,https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/main-news/neighborhood-empowerment-zone-created-to-spur-inward-growth-in-abilene/1306934025

SheBelieves Cup Format: The SheBelieves Cup tournament format will be the same as the first three years. The winner will be based on total points (three for a win, one for a draw), with the first tie-breaker being overall goal difference, followed by goals scored, then head-to-head result. If teams are still tied, the next tie-breaker will be the Fair Play ranking. Each Team is allowed six substitutes per game.

USA vs. England: The USA is 10-4-1 all-time against England. The last four meetings between the teams have been 1-0 results, three wins for the USA and one for England. The most recent meeting came at the 2018 SheBelieves Cup with the lone goal coming when a Megan Rapinoe cross hit off defender Millie Bright and off goalkeeper Karen Bardsley before spinning into the net. The USA beat England 1-0 on Feb. 13, 2015, in Milton Keynes, England with the lone goal coming from an Alex Morgan header and at the 2016 SheBelieves Cup in Tampa, Fla, on a brilliant goal from Crystal Dunn. The USA has nine players on its roster that played in last year’s meeting with England at the SheBelieves Cup, including nine that started, while England has 12, including eight who started. U.S. defender Dunn, who played her last match with Chelsea on Feb. 24, 2018, in a 2-2 tie with Manchester City, will be reunited with several of her teammates during this tournament.

100 Goals Watch: After scoring against Japan on Feb. 27 in Chester, Alex Morgan – the 2018 U.S. Soccer Player of the Year, now has 99 goals and at age 29 sits in sole possession of seventh place on the USA’s all-time goal scoring list. She has scored 26 goals over her last 29 WNT matches through the end of 2017 and 2018 and into 2019. With her hat trick against Japan on July 26, 2018, the fourth of her career, Morgan is now tied with Michelle Akers in third place all-time in multi-goal games (26) behind Abby Wambach (45) and Mia Hamm (38). She has 22 career two-goal games. Morgan has scored against 28 different countries and in 11 different countries. Since the start of 2014, Alex Morgan has scored eight goals against Japan, tied for the most goals any WNT player has against any opponent in that time.

SheBelieves Cup Promotes Message of Empowerment : SheBelieves started as a hashtag in 2015 leading up to the FIFA Women’s World Cup when the U.S. Women’s National Team shared a call to action for young women to set high goals and work to be the best on the field, or in their chosen field, whether it was academics, the arts, finance, technology or wherever their interests led them. In 2016, U.S. Soccer started an elite four-team women’s international tournament and named it the SheBelieves Cup. Since then, the tournament and the message have grown. With the support of U.S. Soccer, its partners, the fans and the players, SheBelieves has succeeded to make an impact beyond the soccer field.

Countdown to the Cup: The 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cupwill be the eighth consecutive World Cup appearance for the USA, which has appeared in each of the previous seven tournaments that have been contested and won in 1991, 1999 and 2015. The USA is one of six countries to qualify for all eight Women’s World Cups along with Brazil, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Nigeria. The tournament will be held from June 7-July 7 in nine cities in France. The USA’s Draw and placement in Group F gave the USA venues that are all within a two-hour drive of each other, with the opening game taking place in Reims, followed by Paris and then Le Havre. The “Countdown to the Cup” will take the WNT to all four times zones in the continental United States, giving fans across the country a chance to cheer the team on to France.

USA Brings SheBelieves Cup to Nashville: The U.S. is unbeaten in its three all-time games in Nashville dating back to the first match in 2004 at what is now Nissan Stadium. Two of those games were 1-0 wins – over Canada in 2004 and France in 2016 – along with a 3-1 win over Scotland on Feb. 13 that was Tom Sermanni’s second game as head coach.

New Rules Get Test Run at SheBelieves Cup: In preparation for the 2019 SheBelieves Cup and the road to the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France, U.S. Soccer requested and received approval from the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to implement three changes to the Laws of the Game during the tournament.

The 133rd AGM of The IFAB will be held in Aberdeen, Scotland on March 2, 2019. At this event it is very likely that the following changes (as well as additional changes that are being proposed for ratification) will be approved to the Laws of the Game for 2019/20 and be ratified:

A player being substituted must leave the field of play at the nearest point on the boundary line.

Yellow and red cards for misconduct can be issued to team officials.

On a goal kick and a free kick for the defending team in their own penalty area, the ball is in play as soon as the kick is taken so a player – or opponent as long as they started outside the penalty or were not given the proper time to exit the penalty – can play the ball before it leaves the penalty area.

forbes,Opportunity Zones May Help Investors And Syndicators More Than Distressed Communities,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) created a new tax-advantaged Opportunity Zone program to encourage investments in economically-distressed communities that are nominated by governors and certified by the Treasury Department. Congress had previously tried similar approaches with Empowerment Zones and Renewal Communities. But its latest effort is remarkable for its lack of a governmental oversight role and for its generosity to investors.

The law allows taxpayers to postpone until 2026 taxes on profits from the sale of any property, if the profits from the sale are reinvested in an Opportunity Zone fund that, in turn, invests in businesses in a targeted community. It also allows taxpayers to exclude from tax any gains that arise from investing in the fund if the fund is held for 10 years. This opens the door to big profits for both investors and syndicators, even as the social benefits of the initiative are unclear at best.

The process works like this: Assume a taxpayer recognizes a $200,000 profit on the sale of stock in a public company. By investing the amount of the gain in an Opportunity Zone fund, she can postpone capital gains taxes until 2026. If the taxpayer holds her Opportunity Zone fund shares for five years, her $200,000 deferred gain is reduced by 10 percent, to $180,000. After seven years, it is reduced by another 5 percent, to $170.000. And, if she sells after 10 years, she may exclude any appreciation in the value of the Opportunity Zone Fund shares. Thus, if she sold her fund shares for $300,000, she could exclude from tax her entire $100,000 gain (her basis would be $200,000, even though she had recognized only $170,000 of deferred gain). Investment banks, syndicators, or anyone else may establish opportunity zone funds. For a fee, of course.

The Joint Committee on Taxation scored the new tax incentive program as a small revenue loser over the budget window, primarily because the deferred gain must be recognized by 2026, which was within TCJA’s 10-year budget window. But because the incentives for Opportunity Zone investments are so much more generous than prior programs, the revenue loss might turn out to be substantial, and far out of proportion to the local economic development they are intended to encourage.

The new Opportunity Zones have three novel features:

First, a taxpayer need only reinvest gains, not the entire proceeds from a sale of assets. The capital gains provisions of the earlier programs noted above required a taxpayer to reinvest all sales proceeds, not just profits. Other provisions in the tax code that defer gains also require reinvestment of all proceeds (e.g., like-kind exchanges, involuntary conversions, etc.).

Second, the other programs permitted a taxpayer to defer gains from the sale of assets within a qualified zone, but not defer gains from the sale of assets outside the zone. Another change: Empowerment Zone and Renewal Communities programs permitted only capital gains to be deferred, but the new program appears to permit other income to be deferred, like gains from the sale of inventory, though this may have been a drafting error.

Finally, syndicators may organize and market the opportunity funds, which can invest more expansively than earlier programs could. The Treasury has certified 8,700 Opportunity Zones, twelve percent of U.S. census tracts, many of which already attract businesses and investments. By comparison, Congress authorized only 40 empowerment zones and 40 renewal communities.

In addition, eligible Opportunity Zone businesses are more wide-ranging, including investments such as residential rental property businesses, which were excluded by the earlier programs. The additional businesses may be lower risk for investors and, perhaps, less beneficial for the community.

The fundamental problem with Opportunity Zones is the disconnect between the size of the potential tax costs, which are uncapped, and the social benefits from the investments, which will be hard to measure. Presumably, some taxpayers will recharacterize already-planned projects or restructure existing business arrangements through, for example, sale-leasebacks, to obtain the new tax incentives. Other taxpayers may try to invest in already-gentrifying areas that were nominated by governors, lessening the focus on economically distressed communities. And, syndicators may lure other taxpayers with the promise to delay and even eliminate taxes.

We will not know for some time whether the program is worthwhile since Congress asked the IRS to begin reporting on the operations of the program in 2022. But as with many tax incentive programs, Congress might have created a more effective program by investing directly in distressed communities rather than creating new tax subsidies for investors and additional cash flows for syndicators that develop and market the deals.",2018,08,20,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenrosenthal/2018/08/20/opportunity-zones-may-help-investors-and-syndicators-more-than-distressed-communities/

globalnews,"Canada a trailblazer in helping women in conflict zones, but ‘more needs to be done’: UN official","Canada is a trailblazer when it comes to assisting women in humanitarian crises around the world, but far more needs to be done to improve outcomes for women and girls in conflict zones, says the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.

Mark Lowcock, who also serves as the emergency relief coordinator for the humanitarian affairs office of the UN, delivered remarks in Ottawa on Friday as part of a panel discussion delving into the growing need for a more gender-responsive approach to humanitarian emergencies.

He applauded the Trudeau government’s feminist international assistance policy – which includes a plan to eventually ensure 95 per cent of Canada’s foreign aid goes toward initiatives that improve the lives of women and girls – as an example for other countries to emulate.

But he also pointed to many examples of women who continue to face extreme risks of sexual and gender-based violence in areas of conflict around the world, saying more needs to be done to ensure humanitarian aid actually helps the women and girls who are being disproportionately affected.

“The world’s humanitarian agencies do a good job in saving lives and reducing suffering among people caught up in conflict,” Lowcock said. “But we do not do a good enough job for women and girls.”

The Yazidi women who were forced into sexual slavery in Iraq and Syria. The Chibok girls kidnapped in Nigeria. The Rohingya refugees who were gang-raped, tortured and lost family members in brutal mass slaughter in Myanmar. These are the stories of women in crisis zones that have captured the world’s attention, Lowcock said, pointing also to women he has met in other regions who continue to live in dangerous situations with fewer opportunities than men to thrive.

Humanitarian assistance often does not address the specific needs of women, he said.

Every day more than 500 women and girls die from pregnancy and childbirth complications in crisis-affected countries. Also, inadequate help with menstrual hygiene keeps girls confined to tents and shelters, preventing them from accessing services and limiting their mobility.

Girls in conflict zones are more than twice as likely as boys to be out of school and women are often more likely to be infected in disease outbreaks because their cultural practices make them caregivers of the sick.

These are all areas that highlight why women’s needs must be top-of-mind and at the decision-making table when humanitarian aid is rolled out to crisis zones, to ensure they are not only free of further victimization, but also more empowered, Lowcock said.

“Let me be clear that we are making strides in the right direction with all these challenges. But let me be equally be blunt – far more needs to be done.”

One key element is the way in which humanitarian aid is donated.

Often money raised through the UN or other aid organizations comes with conditions attached by donors that it must be spent on certain things, such as immunizations or specific programming. This may not be what women need most for themselves and their families, said Julie Delahanty, executive director of Oxfam Canada.

“That’s not an empowering feeling for the women who are receiving that cash,” she said.

“We have to be asking them what kind of modality they want that assistance in – they may prefer food, and if they prefer food, what kind of food do they want? We often don’t ask them such basic questions.”

Oxfam Canada published a report in October that took a close look at how Canada provides international humanitarian aid and the gaps that exist when it comes to outcomes for women and girls in refugee situations.

READ MORE: Canada should do more to help women, girls displaced by war, Oxfam Canada says

It noted that while Canada has made great improvements with its focus on gender equality and feminism as part of its domestic and foreign policy agenda, Canada’s international assistance spending is at a near-historic low, reaching 0.26 per cent of gross national income, as compared to the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent.

The organization has called on Canada to develop a 10-year plan to achieve the United Nations aid target and also wants Canada to dedicate a slice of its humanitarian assistance to the needs of women and girls.

International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, who also took part in the panel on Friday, pointed to the steps the Trudeau government has already taken, pointing out that half of the humanitarian programs previously funded by her department were “completely gender blind,” which has been almost entirely reversed.

“We are making this big, big shift, making sure all our humanitarian partners are paying attention to the specific needs of women and girls,” Bibeau said. “And not only seeing them as beneficiaries or victims, but really bringing local women around the table for decisions and making sure that throughout implementation of projects, they are building their capacities their leadership, providing opportunities for empowerment.”",2019,02,24,https://globalnews.ca/news/4993920/canada-women-conflict-zones/
usnews,Can Opportunity Zones Revive Struggling Cities?,"Parts of New York City's Bronx (pictured) are amongst the 8,700 distressed areas formally chosen by America’s governors as Opportunity Zones. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)

CLEVELAND —The tech entrepreneur Sean Parker achieved early fame twice, first for upsetting the music industry's business model with his innovative Napster technology and later for being an early champion and president of Facebook and a mentor to its founder Mark Zuckerberg. But the billionaire may just achieve more lasting influence for an entirely different innovation: as one of the intellectual architects of federal Opportunity Zones.

Tucked into the tax act of 2017, this provision – formally known as the Investing in Opportunity Act, a brainchild of Parker's think tank, the Economic Innovation Group – was unnoticed at first, lost in the raging partisan arguments over the steep tax cuts. But as investors and urban advocates began focusing on it as an exciting new tool for assembling patient capital to reinvigorate distressed urban districts, some have called it potentially transformative.

Under the incentive, the IRS now offers qualified investors significant tax savings on capital gains if they invest in projects in one of the 8,700 distressed areas formally chosen by America's governors and certified by the U.S. Treasury and called Opportunity Zones.

Instead of tax credits or other subsidies, the normal mechanisms the federal government uses to entice investors, under Opportunity Zone provisions investors receive temporary tax deferral for capital gains reinvested in designated Opportunity Zones. For investments held longer than 10 years, that deferral converts to forgiveness, encouraging the formation of so-called ""patient capital,"" money that isn't quickly repositioned to chase profits but instead supports long-term projects.

It works this way: An investor might buy stock for $10,000 and sell it for $15,000. If the capital gain of $5,000 is then reinvested in a fund devoted to Opportunity Zone projects, the gains on that investment are then eligible for reduction or forgiveness, depending on the time horizon.

That means a giant pool of unrealized capital gains – the profits from the sale of property or stocks – estimated at $6.1 trillion, is eligible for these reinvestments. As the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Anthony Veerkamp recently observed, that ""constitute(s) either the most significant federal community development incentive in a generation or one of the biggest tax giveaways to the rich in American history.""

Prominent urban policy guru Bruce Katz says the country has never seen an economic development tool like Opportunity Zones before. ""I would say most tax incentives that were intended to drive capital into low-income communities – whether they're urban, suburban or rural – were really policy tools, like the historic preservation credit, or the new market credit"" – an earlier plan for luring new investment to distressed areas – and were earmarked for particular ends, he says. ""But this is open-ended. You could fund an energy project or housing.""

Katz, a former chief of staff for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros and later director of the metropolitan policy program at the Brookings Institute, is an unabashed admirer of the idea. He even thinks it could repair some of the worst ravages of mid-century urban renewal, especially in areas with relatively weak economies.

""Urban renewal happened 60, 65 year ago and basically devastated our downtowns,"" he says. ""It ripped them apart. It demolished historic structures. It built parking lots, which were supposed to be temporary. But they became permanent."" So if this new way of investing in these areas can repair that damage and improve the employment and fiscal base, he says, then he's all for it.

He notes that booming coastal markets and thriving inland regions like Denver and Austin don't really need these zones to stimulate demand. The interest will be greater in forgotten places such as South Bend, Indiana, Oklahoma City and Dayton, Ohio. And, he notes, ""the country is more Dayton than Austin.""

But there are deep concerns among some about the lack of normal rules governing these investments. Unlike just about every other federal program designed to promote investment in distressed urban areas, the Opportunity Zone legislation requires no particular outcomes or barometers for judging whether these investments will actually stimulate real improvements in these places. Nor is there any cap on the amount that can be invested.

That's why some critics dismiss them as little more than tax giveaways to wealthy developers. Eyebrows were also raised when media reports surfaced that the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, had established a fund devoted to taking advantage of the new investment vehicle, after they personally lobbied for the provision.

""Without requirements around beneficial impact, creation of affordable housing and measurements that make sure you're producing social good other than investment gains, the significant incentive is for rapid gentrification,"" says Jesse Van Tol, CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. ""There's also no data-reporting requirement. So we may not know what the impact is. From a transparency perspective, how are we going to know 10 years from now if this public policy was a success?""

Some of the lack of enthusiasm for these new investment vehicles perhaps can be traced to the modest effects of past programs targeting distressed urban areas, like the Empowerment Zones pushed through by the Clinton Administration in the 1990s, which political scientist Timothy Weaver found to be ineffective at stimulating inner city development in the research for his book, ""Blazing the Neoliberal Trail."" But Katz notes how fundamentally different this program is than in the past. In fact, he says it isn't even a program, but rather a tool. And unlike past tax incentive programs, directed at businesses, these are directed at investors.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently said as much as $100 billion of new capital could eventually flow to Opportunity Zone projects. Others expect it to be far more. ""This isn't a rat hole idea picked from the far right or far left,"" the bill's co-sponsor Sen. Cory Booker told a New Jersey audience last year. ""This is simple business economics of us understanding what governs the investment psychology of people in this country.""

Katz says he has visited perhaps 150 of the zones already and is finding plenty of interest. He is excited by the notion of entrepreneurs and innovators in all sorts of industries and sectors of the economy using the tax incentives to attack problems differently.

""We've got a lot of entrepreneurs in different parts of our economy,"" he says. ""They're not just in the venture start-ups in Silicon Valley. There are a lot of very smart entrepreneurs inside companies, outside companies, in multiple sectors of our economy. So in a way what this tool does, is it says to people who are first movers in their sectors – whether it's hospitals, universities, public housing, you name it – 'If you figure out how this tool works, it's going to redound to your benefit first.' But then it's going to become routine, so it can basically be scaled across the country.""

If the absence of traditional guardrails is cause for concern to people like Van Tol, Katz says that's the heart of the appeal to those most likely to take advantage of opportunity zone deals.

""When you have the federal government promulgating rules but not providing guidance, the country has basically been told, 'It's up to you to figure out the models and norms here.' And that's what's happening.""

taxfoundation,Opportunity Zones: What We Know and What We Don’t,"Key Findings

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created the Opportunity Zones program to spur investment in economically distressed census tracts. Opportunity zones reduce capital gains taxes for individuals and businesses who invest in qualified opportunity zones.

Opportunity zones were estimated to cost $1.6 billion in revenue from 2018-2027. New regulations stipulate that the program’s benefits would continue through 2047, meaning the program’s revenue impact could increase over time depending on how many investors utilize the program.

Research suggests place-based incentive programs redistribute rather than generate new economic activity, subsidize investments that would have occurred anyway, and displace low-income residents by increasing property values and encouraging higher skilled workers to relocate to the area.

While opportunity zones present certain budgetary and economic costs, it is unclear whether opportunity zone tax preferences used to attract investment will actually benefit distressed communities.

Introduction

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) created the Opportunity Zones program to increase investment in economically distressed communities. The program provides preferential capital gains treatment for investments within designated low-income census tracts. Policymakers hope opportunity zones will unleash investment in low-income communities throughout the country.[1]

This analysis describes opportunity zone program incentives, reviews both academic and government evidence on the effects of place-based incentive programs, and discusses possible outcomes for opportunity zone residents. Overall, we find opportunity zones will present certain budgetary and economic costs to taxpayers and investors, but based on evidence from other place-based incentive programs, we cannot be certain opportunity zones will generate sustained economic development for distressed communities.

Capital Gains Taxes

A capital gain is the profit earned when an asset, such as an investment or property, is sold. Short-term capital gains, or profits on assets sold within one year of purchase, are taxed at a taxpayer’s ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains, or gains from assets held longer than a year, are taxed at either 0 percent, 15 percent, or 20 percent, based on a taxpayer’s income.[2] Individuals with income above $200,000 ($250,000 for married filers) are subject to an additional 3.8 percent tax on their net investment income.[3]

Consider an investor who bought shares in a company for $25,000. Ten years later, the value of those shares has increased to $50,000. The investor then sells those shares, realizing a capital gain of $25,000 on the original investment. Assuming the investor’s income triggers a 15 percent tax on this capital gain, their tax liability would be $3,750. This brings the investor’s total post-tax earnings to $21,250.

Opportunity Zones

The Opportunity Zones Program attracts investment to economically distressed communities by modifying this standard tax treatment of capital gains in several ways. These modifications either delay or reduce the capital gains tax liability of investors. But to qualify for these benefits, investors must reinvest one or more capital gains in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF).[4]

Qualified Opportunity Funds

The TCJA describes a QOF as any investment vehicle organized as a partnership or corporation that holds 90 percent or more of its assets in qualified opportunity zone property, other than another qualified opportunity fund.[5] Proposed regulations would require 70 percent, or “substantially all,” of a business’s tangible business property be in an opportunity zone to qualify for QOF funding. Combining the 90 percent asset requirement for opportunity funds with the 70 percent tangible property requirement for qualifying businesses means that a QOF may be as minimally invested in a zone as 63 percent.[6] These proposed regulations would also require that “50 percent of the gross income of a qualified opportunity zone business [be] derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in the qualified opportunity zone.”[7]

Tax Treatment of QOF Investments

An investor can receive up to three tax benefits by reinvesting capital gains in a QOF.[8] The first is temporary tax deferral on any capital gains reinvested in a QOF within 180 days of realization.[9] Tax payment is deferred until the investment is sold or exchanged, or until December 31st, 2026, whichever comes first.[10]

The second benefit is a 10 percent step-up in basis for capital gains reinvested in a QOF if the investment is held for five years. The basis is increased an additional 5 percent for any investments held for seven years.[11] This step-up in basis means taxpayers can exclude up to 15 percent of the value of their reinvested capital gains from their taxable income, decreasing the investor’s tax liability when they sell or can no longer defer taxation.[12]

Finally, QOF investors can permanently exclude from taxation any capital gains that accrue after their investment in a QOF, if the investment is held for at least 10 years. Opportunity zones increase the basis of any investment held in a QOF for 10 years to 100 percent of its fair market value on the date it is sold or exchanged.[13]

Table 2 provides an example of the tax savings opportunity zones can provide to an investor who holds an investment in a QOF for seven years. This sample investor had originally invested $1 million and sold it for $2.5 million, for a gain of $1.5 million. Under the traditional system, they would owe $357,000 in capital gains taxes. However, if the investor invested the $2.5 million in a QOF, they would save $53,550 in capital gains taxes. This is because the step-up in basis means they pay taxes on just $1.275 million in capital gains rather than the original capital gain of $1.5 million.

Table 3 shows that any gain accrued after the $1.5 million investment in the QOF is exempt from taxation if it is held for 10 years or longer. Assuming the investor made another $500,000 over the decade of the QOF investment, the investor would save an additional $119,000 in taxes.

In total, this sample investor saves $172,550 in taxes by reinvesting their $1.5 million capital gain in an opportunity zone and holding that investment for 10 years.

Budgetary and Economic Costs of the Opportunity Zone Program

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates the Opportunity Zones program will cost $1.6 billion between 2018 and 2027. The program is estimated to decrease revenue between 2018 and 2025 but generate revenue in 2026 and 2027, as investors can no longer defer taxes on the capital gains they reinvested in QOFs.[14]

Table 4. Annual Cost Estimates of Opportunity Zones Source: Joint Committee on Taxation, “Estimated Budget Effects of the Conference Agreement for H.R. 1, The ‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.’” Opportunity Zone Cost (Billions of Dollars) 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 -1.2 -1.7 -1.6 -1.7 -1.6 -1.5 -1.5 -1.6 8.1 2.7

Importantly, new regulations stipulate that the program’s benefits would continue through at least 2048, meaning the revenue impact of the program could increase over time depending on how much activity occurs within opportunity zones.[15]

We also know that, as with any tax provision, the economic cost of the program will exceed its budgetary cost. Navigating the program’s new set of rules and regulations will generate direct compliance costs for investors, and investors will forgo investments in other areas of the economy to take advantage of the program’s tax incentives.[16]

Evidence on Place-Based Incentive Programs

Governments use place-based incentive programs to subsidize firms or investors who operate in specific areas, often with the intent to revitalize economically depressed communities. In the U.S., place-based incentive programs occur at all levels of government and are often (but not always) called “Enterprise Zones.”

These zones operate in areas with some mixture of high unemployment, population decline, vacant buildings, or residents with low income or low education levels. They usually require qualifying firms or investors to create a specified number of jobs or maintain a certain level of wages for residents within the zone. In return, firms and investors receive benefits like corporate income tax credits for job creation and investment, sales tax exemptions, or financial assistance through low interest rate loans. Some programs also provide benefits like workforce development within these areas.[17]

Several theoretical rationales underpin these programs. First, the cost of doing business in economically distressed areas is higher for several reasons, including less access to skilled labor and transportation, as well as higher crime. Theoretically, subsidies offered by place-based incentive programs can offset these costs and encourage businesses to locate in distressed areas.[18]

Become a TCJA Expert With Our 2-week Crash Course!

The “spatial mismatch” theory argues people can become trapped in low-income areas for several reasons, such as an inability to incur the cost of moving to and living in a more productive area. In theory, place-based incentives can draw investment that will generate employment opportunities for immobile residents.[19]

Some have also argued place-based incentive programs can attract highly-skilled people to productive urban centers where they can experiment, innovate, and learn from other highly skilled people. These productive “agglomeration economies” then generate benefits that “spill over” to other areas of the economy.[20]

However, measuring the effectiveness of place-based incentive programs is challenging. For one, program boundaries are not always delineated by census tracts or zip codes, making data collection difficult.[21] And even when data is available, oftentimes, multiple place-based programs intervene in the same area, making it difficult to isolate the effects of one program relative to another. Making matters more complicated, it is difficult to find areas that are similar to zones but have not received benefits.[22] Without a counterfactual, it’s difficult to measure success.[23]

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given these measurement difficulties, there is no academic consensus on whether place-based incentive programs work as intended. In fact, research suggests programs fail to generate new employment often because subsidized firms replace nonsubsidized firms, or because firms simply shift their current business activities for tax purposes. Research also suggests the benefits of place-based incentives accrue primarily to landowners and higher-skilled mobile workers who can travel for employment, effectively displacing the low-income residents the programs are meant to help. [24]

Displacement Effects

Opportunity zone tax breaks will attract investment (at least in the short term) and this capital will require labor. But investors are not required to create jobs that fit the skills of zone residents.[25] If these investments generate employment opportunities that do not match the skills of existing residents, workers from outside the jurisdiction could take the employment opportunities instead.[26]

Evidence shows that this skills mismatch problem does occur. For instance, Maryland’s Department of Legislative Services (DLS) found “a significant mismatch between the skills of those who fill[ed] the private jobs within enterprise zones and those who reside[d] in or near the zones.”[27] Overall, DLS estimated only about one in eight enterprise zone jobs, or 12 percent, were filled by community residents. DLS concluded:

While enterprise zone tax credits may incentivize some businesses to create additional jobs within enterprise zones, the tax credit is not effective in providing employment to zone residents that are chronically unemployed and/or live in poverty. A number of factors contribute to this problem, including skills mismatches for new jobs created, lower than average educational attainment levels of zone residents, and labor mobility.[28]

Place-based incentives can also pressure nonsubsidized firms out of business by providing subsidies to their competitors. For instance, in a 2010 report, Louisiana Economic Development cautioned that of the 9,379 jobs attributed to the state’s Enterprise Zone program in 2009, only 3,000 jobs could be considered new. The report cautioned many of the projects associated with the program would have occurred regardless of the incentive, and many new jobs simply replaced others.[29]

Place-based incentive programs could displace low-income residents by increasing property values.[30] As capital and labor move into a zone, this could put upward pressure on wages and housing prices. While this would benefit landowners in a region, it could be problematic to low-income individuals if it makes housing unaffordable. In the case of opportunity zones, the site-selection process which places zones in gentrifying areas could exacerbate this effect.[31]

Opportunity Zone Data is Necessary to Compare the Program’s Outcomes with Alternative Approaches

Given that there is no consensus on the efficacy of place-based incentive programs, gathering data on opportunity zones is crucial. Senators Corey Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott (R-SC) had originally included provisions for annual data collection beginning five years after the bill passed, but those provisions were dropped in the final version of the TCJA.[32]

Without data, it is impossible to judge the merits of place-based incentive programs relative to other economic development approaches. Take the federal government’s experience with Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities, all place-based incentive programs that subsidized firms for locating in particular areas to help develop distressed communities. In 2010, the Government Accountability Office found:

[D]ata limitations make it difficult to accurately tie the use of the credits to specific designated communities. It is not clear how much businesses are using other EZ, EC, and RC tax incentives, because IRS forms do not associate these incentives with the programs or with specific designated communities.… making it difficult to begin assessing the impacts of these tax benefits.[33]

Fortunately, future rounds of opportunity zone regulations will likely include reporting requirements that would allow economists to evaluate program impacts.[34] The White House has also created an Opportunity and Revitalization Council that will, among other things, assess “what data, metrics, and methodologies can be used to measure the effectiveness of public and private investments in urban and economically distressed communities, including qualified opportunity zones.”[35] Both developments can help policymakers assess the effectiveness of opportunity zones relative to other economic development policies.[36]

Conclusion

With opportunity zones, and any other place-based incentive program, it’s important to consider what we know, as well as what we don’t. We know the program will attract at least some investment to low-income census tracts designated as zones. We also know that this investment will come at both a budgetary and economic cost.

But we don’t know how effective opportunity zones will be at improving the lives of low-income people in economically distressed communities. Both research and state level experience raise concerns that opportunity zones could actually be counterproductive to generating sustained development in these communities.

For now, policymakers should emphasize the data collection necessary to measure the effects of this program. Without it, we will be unable to measure the merits of this place-based approach compared to other alternatives that could more effectively develop economically distressed communities.

[12] Investors must invest their capital gains in a QOF before the end of 2019 to receive the full 15 percent step-up in basis after seven years. This is because the TCJA requires investors to realize deferred gains by the end of 2026. See Roger Russell, “Tax experts weigh in on Qualified Opportunity Zones,” AccountingToday, Dec. 3, 2018, https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/tax-experts-weigh-in-on-qualified-opportunity-zones. Note also that the step-up in basis reduces the taxable amount of a reinvested capital gain even if the gain loses value between investment and realization, providing a tax benefit to investors who experience capital losses.

[21] Opportunity zones are easier in some ways. For instance, they are delineated by census tracts, and the fact that there could be some census tracts that were similar (but not chosen) could give researchers a counterfactual. But the fact that measurement difficulties have kept researchers from finding a consensus puts policymakers on unsure footing to know whether the program will be successful.

[22] Oregon’s Legislative Revenue Office (LRO) provides an example of how counterfactuals can be created to measure a program’s effectiveness. LRO identified comparison areas for each of its enterprise zone regions using employment data at the two-digit North American Industry Classification System private industry code level. While they could not identify perfect counterfactuals, their estimate was close to an apples-to-apples comparison. Careful methods should be adopted by more government program evaluators.

[27] Of Maryland’s five Enterprise Zone regions, only one region’s employment figures consisted of more than 10 percent low-skilled jobs (12 percent of jobs in “Capital Region” were low-skilled). On the other hand, 57 percent of the jobs created in the “Baltimore City” zone were high-skilled workers, while only 4 percent qualified as low-skilled. Low-skilled employment included construction, mining, and logging; semi-skilled included manufacturing, utilities, trade and transportation, leisure/hospitality, and other services; high-skilled included information, financial activities, education, health care, professional/scientific/technical, and business services. DLS based its skill categories off the framework created in Marcello M.

[28] Maryland’s Baltimore City region employed the most community zone workers at 32 percent, likely because it is significantly larger than the other four zones and comprises a significant portion of the commercial and industrial areas of the city. Maryland’s other four zones all employed fewer than 15 percent community residents. Western Maryland’s zone employed 14 percent of workers from the zone community, Greater Baltimore Area 13 percent, Eastern Shore 8 percent, and Capital Region 6 percent.

[31] A study of California’s opportunity zones in the Bay Area showed that around 18.8 percent of tracts designated were in areas that had already seen “significant socioeconomic change” between 2000 and 2016, compared to only 2.7 percent of eligible tracts nationwide. The authors created a measure of investment that ranked tracts eligible for opportunity zone investment from 1 (lowest investment) to 10 (highest investment), based on a tract’s “current level of commercial, multifamily, single-family, and small-business investment.” They found that a quarter of the Bay Area’s zones were “among the most disinvested in the state,” but also that almost 40 percent of the Bay Area’s zones scored an 8 or higher on their investment ranking. The authors measured socioeconomic change in these tracts by examining characteristics like the average housing burden, median family income, and share of residents with a bachelor’s degree or higher.

See also, an analysis by The Brookings Institution on the first 18 states to designate their zones. The authors found 22 percent of the selections were for areas with relatively low poverty rates (as opposed to “deeply impoverished”), and another 19 percent of the areas were what they considered to be already-gentrifying. Overall, they found 28 percent of the zones designated were either not poor, college campuses, or in areas where no one lived.

[36] It’s worth noting that there is no lack of funds available for investment, especially when you consider global savings. And reforms that generally—as opposed to just for specific firms, industries, or areas—increase after-tax returns on capital can attract these savings for investment, which will create employment and increase wages. With a general approach, however, policymakers will be unable to predict exactly where this growth will occur. For this reason, research suggests the best way to increase opportunity for low-income individuals may be to reduce or remove barriers that keep low-income people from moving to more productive areas.

masslive,"Springfield teachers, Empowerment Zone schools praised by Gov. Charlie Baker","SPRINGFIELD -- Two teachers who represented the Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership during Gov. Charlie Baker's State of the Commonwealth speech said it is a testament to the work being done by administrators, teachers, parents and students.

""It was a phenomenal experience,"" said Tammy Grimes, chairwoman of the special education department at the High School of Commerce, which was the first high school in the district to join the empowerment zone.

Established in 2015, the zone is a partnership between the state, Springfield school officials and the teachers union in which eight public middle schools and now Commerce are overseen by a board and granted more autonomy to make decisions in areas like hiring, scheduling, budgeting and curriculum.

As he did last year, Baker said he will look to Springfield's empowerment zone schools as a model for how to help struggling schools across the state.

""Collaborative approaches like this one are working in Springfield,"" Baker said. ""And can work in other struggling districts as well.""

He mentioned his visit to Commerce and an interaction with Grimes that stuck with him.

""I remember him asking me with so many different approaches why do I believe in this one, and I am so passionate about what we are doing here. I feel like that resonated with him and he invited me to attend the address,"" she said.

Grimes said working in the empowerment zone is the first time as a teacher that she has felt like she has real input.

""This is a bold, but sustainable approach that is inclusive in nature,"" she said.

For John J. Duggan Academy teacher Evan Christner, being able to represent his school and the zone was ""a once in a lifetime experience,"" he said.

Christner said he is proud of everyone at the school for their hard work and determination to improve the outcome for Springfield students.

""I was absolutely honored to represent all of the teachers and the administrators and the students. It's great to see that our hard work is not going unnoticed,"" he said. ""It also reassures us that we are going in the right direction.""

Julie Swerdlo Albino, the zone's co-executive director, said improvements are happening at all of the schools, especially when it comes to English language arts scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS).

""We're seeing promising initial results, especially in ELA, that show this approach is working,"" she said.

She also said everyone was excited to have Baker recognize the work happening in Springfield.

""We were thrilled that Governor Baker recognized our educators in his address, and that he highlighted the successful collaboration here in Springfield,"" she said. ""Collaboration is absolutely at the heart of our mission in the zone. We are really focused on partnering with the district, teachers' union, and our educators and families to improve outcomes for students. We're on the right path because we're working together.""",2018,01,24,https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/01/springfield_teachers_empowerme.html
washingtonpost,"As Americans reject vaccines, health workers abroad risk death to deliver them","

A nurse administers a measles vaccine to a student in Yemen on Feb. 9, 2019, during a week-long vaccination campaign against measles at a school amid a rapidly spreading outbreak. (Yahya Arhab/EPA-EFE)

In early October, three cases of measles were confirmed in Antanarivo, the capital of Madagascar. The highly contagious virus quickly spread across the island nation; by the next month, thousands of cases had been confirmed. The crisis only grew from there.

Madagascar has poor health-care infrastructure and a low vaccination rate. But public health experts say its dangerous measles outbreak still offers a warning for anti-vaccination campaigners in the United States, where a smaller-scale flare-up has led to more than 100 confirmed cases since the beginning of the year. Conspiracy theories that vaccines are ineffective or can cause certain disabilities and medical conditions have led a number of American parents to resist vaccinating their children.

“Madagascar started with a few cases; now, we are almost close to 60,000 and the cases are still increasing,” said Richard Mihigo, coordinator for the World Health Organization’s immunization and vaccine development program at its regional office for Africa. “I think societies like the U.S. and western Europe should ring the bell and see … this is something that could also happen to them.”

[A global wave of measles cases fed by conspiracies and misinformation has health officials worried]

The outbreak in Madagascar is due in large part to weak infrastructure that has made it difficult to achieve widespread vaccination. Both there and elsewhere, health workers face extraordinary circumstances, and at times take immense personal risks, to deliver vaccines to vulnerable communities. In 2013, health workers in northern Nigeria were wrapping up an immunization drive to help vaccinate children against the polio virus when armed gunmen appeared and opened fire, killing at least nine of them.

Targeted killings of health-care workers are even more common in Pakistan, where medical staff have also been killed while delivering vaccines to rural areas or conflict zones in an attempt to control the spread of polio.

“When we see that a society where this is not the case sees it as something to take for granted, it’s very sad,” Mihigo said of the United States and Europe.

Even outside of high-risk areas or conflict zones, delivering vaccines in developing countries can pose serious logistical challenges.

Natalie Roberts, emergency operations manager at Doctors Without Borders, said that in parts of Congo, where a measles outbreak is ongoing, staff with the nonprofit group will travel days by motorbike or canoe to access isolated villages. “You can spend five days going from one place to the next area and then spend eight hours trying to get the car out of a hole and reach the village you’re trying to access, and you notice there are maybe 100 children in the village,” she said. “And you’ve spent days and days to get there.”

In places like Madagascar, health workers face similar logistical challenges while delivering vaccines. For measles herd immunity to be effective, public health experts recommend that at least 95 percent of the general population be vaccinated. In Madagascar, the estimated immunization rate was just 58 percent as of 2017. In Washington state, the immunization rate is around 90 percent.

“The reasons that children aren’t vaccinated in Congo are very different from the reasons children aren’t vaccinated in America or Europe,” Roberts said. “But in the end, the result is the same.”

In addition to areas with poor infrastructure, measles and other contagious, preventable diseases often break out in conflict zones, when children are not being vaccinated on schedule. In recent years, outbreaks have occurred in Syria, Yemen and Ukraine.

But in the United States, vaccines that can prevent the spread of measles and other deadly diseases are readily available, stirring frustrations in the public health community over why those who have access to vaccines would refuse them.

“You have at your disposal all the benefits of modern life that are supposed to make your life healthy and strong and long,” said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And then a segment of the population rejects that. It’s exasperating.”

This year, the WHO named “vaccine hesitancy” one of the top threats to global health. Measles has increased by 30 percent globally, the group’s report said, adding that “some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.”

In 2017, the number of measles cases reported grew dramatically, with the largest surge occurring in Europe, the Americas, and the eastern Mediterranean region, the WHO said.

That year, 110,000 people died from measles. Most of them were younger than 5. In 2000, about five times as many people died from the disease, and medical professionals want to ensure they continue to keep the death rate low.

Morrison stressed that in the United States and Europe, where some parents have lost confidence in the science behind vaccines, “you have to win the trust and confidence of people and fight back deliberately against this paranoia.”

In Congo, Roberts said, such paranoia around the measles vaccine is far less common. Outbreaks there are frequent enough that the communities most susceptible to measles have memories of the toll the virus can take on them and urgently want their children to be vaccinated.

“They understand what a real measles epidemic means,” she said. “Maybe in the U.S. and Europe, we’ve forgotten.”

sbnonline,How to navigate the benefits and risks of opportunity zones,"Opportunity zones have captured the attention of many. This program, developed under the federal tax reform, is a tax incentive to develop distressed areas. Investments are made through a qualified opportunity fund for the purpose of investing in these assets.

“There’s quite a bit of interest, seeing what’s on the market, what it’s going to cost and the projected benefits,” says Jim Komos, tax partner-in-charge at Ciuni & Panichi, Inc. “I think it’s going to reawaken projects that didn’t make economic sense before.”

Smart Business spoke with Komos about this innovative program, which is designed to promote development in economically distressed areas by delivering tax benefits to investors.

How are opportunity zones different from programs that have been tried before?

To create opportunity zones, states took census tracts with low property values and decided where they want to encourage development. It’s broader in scope than prior programs. Empowerment zones or renewal communities might have picked 40 or 50 qualifying areas. More than 8,000 opportunity zones have been identified throughout the U.S. and its territories.

The program also isn’t subject to as much bureaucracy as other programs, such as the earned income tax or new market tax credit. Opportunity zones are much simpler.

Who benefits from opportunity zones?

Property owners and residents are one beneficiary. Property is worth more and residents may see their neighborhoods spruced up with new facilities or construction redevelopment. In some cases, business owners who have been wanting to move may now be in an opportunity zone. This program could open up the market.

Developers and investors benefit in three ways:

1. They can defer taxation on capital gains for up to 10 years if they invest in an opportunity zone. However, those gains must incur within six months of the investment. Many investors are looking at opportunities within the zones prior to incurring a gain — selling a property — and creating the related opportunity fund.

2. If they stay in that fund for at least five years, 10 percent of that gain is eliminated. If they stay for seven years, another 5 percent is wiped off the books.

3. If they have gains on their opportunity zone investment, it will not be taxed. For example, an investor buys a factory for $1 million, and then sells it for $2 million 10 years later. That $1 million appreciation will not be taxed.

What restrictions could limit who can benefit from opportunity zones?

Along with making sure the opportunity fund application is filed by the developer, there are some investment restrictions. In most cases, 90 percent of the property, or the assets in that fund, have to be qualifying assets. There are different definitions of qualifying assets, whether it’s an operating business or real estate. (Real estate is a little more restrictive.) Generally, investors need to be improving the property or bringing new business into the area.

Where are the opportunity zones in Northeast Ohio?

Broadly, most of the downtown areas of major cities fall into the opportunity zones. That means much of downtown Cleveland, quite bit of downtown Akron, Youngstown, Warren, etc. But, surprisingly, there are other areas like around Warrensville Heights that also fall into an opportunity zone. For a full listing, including a map broken down by address, visit this opportunity zone resource page from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

What are some risks to be aware of?

This is a hot topic, but investors need to be careful. They should work with people who know what they’re doing to ensure their investments will actually qualify for the exclusions and deferrals.

In addition, investors shouldn’t overpay or get taken in by high fees. Too often, people are so excited about the tax benefits and deferring the tax, they don’t realize they’re paying too much for the property. Or, if they’re investing through a developer, the developer takes too much for himself — rather than getting 20 percent of the upside, maybe he’s taking 30 percent. So, investors must make sure, overall, it’s a good economic investment.

thepantheronline,"From spanking sticks to phallic candy, ‘One Big Sex Night’ aims to sexually empower students","On any given day, Argyros Forum is a cozy hub for students on Chapman’s campus, home to Jamba Juice, study nooks and bagels – but on Wednesday night, it became home to a sex education extravaganza with hand-drawn posters of male and female erogenous zones, penis-shaped lollipops and casual conversations about bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism, also known as BDSM.

Every February, Chapman’s University Program Board Club (UPB) hosts its annual “One Big Sex Night,” where employees from the Pleasure Chest, an adult entertainment store in Los Angeles, California, come to teach Chapman students about everything from enhancing sexual experiences, to consent, to spanking sticks.

“I was expecting the a cappella groups to sing about sex like they did in ‘Pitch Perfect,’ but I actually thought the speaker was much more entertaining,” said Kirstin Bastin, a freshman vocal performance major.

The evening was not quite what Bastin expected, she said, but she left with “thorough explanations” on topics that ranged from pornography to sex toys.

“I absolutely love teaching college students,” Carly Weckstein, the evening’s representative from the Pleasure Chest, told The Panther. “We imparted knowledge to empower folks to have hot consensual sex.”

Armed with new sexual knowledge, 40 to 50 audience members went home with freebies like phallic candy, BDSM toys, condoms and different lubricants.

Learning about sex as a college student is critical, Weckstein said, and an increase in knowledge can be “empowering,” and her goal is to help students understand ways to enhance their sex lives.

Sex education in college can provide a sometimes much-needed crash course for students who may not have learned the ins and outs of a healthy sex life in high school.

Only 24 states require sex education, according to a 2016 study released by the National Conference of State Legislation and four of those states require parental consent.

But college sex education and open discussions about sex are on the rise – Harvard University hosts a “sex week” each year, 2019 marking its ninth return to campus. This year, a survey found that around half of those surveyed have or believe they have a sexual fetish.

Writing on poster paper in front of her audience, Weckstein asked the crowd to shout out sexual narratives and societal expectations, breaking down the idea that only “sexy” people deserve to have sex.

“Enhancing your sex life is through your own agency,” Weckstein said, aiming to dismantle the sometimes “unrealistic messages” associated with college sex life.",2019,02,07,http://www.thepantheronline.com/news/spanking-sticks-phallic-candy-one-big-sex-night-aims-sexually-empower-students

Dec. 12, 2018, 1:46 PM GMT / Updated Dec. 12, 2018, 2:25 PM GMT By Laura Strickler and Stephanie Ruhle

WASHINGTON — The Trump Organization, the family real estate interests of presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump friend Richard LeFrak, a New York developer, could all benefit from a new federal program that has designated ""opportunity zones"" in ""economically distressed"" areas around the country and offers tax benefits for developers.

Kushner's family already owned real estate on the Jersey Shore, but spent an extra $13.15 million in Long Branch after the area was deemed an opportunity zone by the Treasury Department in April according to Bloomberg News. The Trump Organization was already planning a hotel redevelopment in Greenville, Mississippi, with a partner, but that project is in an area that was declared an opportunity zone in April and could now be eligible for the tax break.

The Trump Organization's partner in Mississippi, Suresh Chawla, told NBC News his firm was unaware of the designation and not planning to participate.

Kushner also has existing properties in two Maryland opportunity zones, while the Trump Organization owns a New Jersey golf course inside another. Kushner's family company and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.

Richard LeFrak has a $4 billion, 183-acre massive development called SoLe Mia in North Miami that is now right in the middle of a zone. As a new project it could also qualify. Lefrak's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. LeFrak is a longtime associate of Trump's who has spent time with him at Mar-a-Lago. According to the New York Times, Trump asked LeFrak to build the border wall.

President Donald Trump will tout the program in an event to be held at the White House Wednesday.

The program, created by the 2017 tax bill and run by the Treasury Department, allowed state governors latitude to name 8,700 areas as opportunity zones. All the zones were certified by Treasury in April 2018. The excitement in the investor community has been balanced by a growing unease among housing and economic development experts that the program lacks government oversight.

A White House spokesperson told NBC News that reporting requirements are a work in progress. The spokesperson said a new council headed by HUD Secretary Ben Carson will determine “what data and by what means it can be collected and analyzed to measure the success of Opportunity Zones.”

For its part, the Chamber of Commerce has been enthusiastic about the program, ""This program is another way tax reform delivered on its promise to create jobs and improve lives for all Americans,"" said Chamber Vice President Caroline Harris in an emailed statement to NBC News. ""The Chamber is strongly encouraged by recent regulatory guidance and looks forward to continue working with Treasury to maximize economic growth potential from this initiative.""

Now that Treasury has certified the zones, developers are encouraged to plow their capital gains into those neighborhoods. Investors pay reduced rates on capital gains invested in the zones, and can qualify to have capital gains realized within the zones exempt from taxes altogether.

Real estate experts are already seeing a bump in some property values.

Critics have noted that some of the designated zones were already on the upswing, and they say a generous program meant to steer billions to low-income neighborhoods might instead concentrate investments in gentrifying communities like Brooklyn and Miami.

For example, a two-bedroom condo in Brooklyn Heights with a private garden selling for more than $700,000 is in a zone and — according to the Treasury — in an ""economically distressed"" community. The median home sale price in Brooklyn Heights, which is one subway stop from Manhattan's Financial District, is now more than $2.3 million, according to Trulia.

The tax legislation said that only census tracts with poverty rates at 20 percent or above could qualify. But almost a fifth of the zones were certified by the Treasury Department through provisions that allowed wealthier zones to be designated, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution.

As a result, some zones are in places not usually associated with the phrase ""economically distressed,"" such as downtown Charleston, South Carolina, or a zone in West Palm Beach.

The latest figures show $15 billion in new investments is already anticipated.

""I think the whole thing is painting a picture of a program which will benefit areas that are already attracting investment capital,"" said Jim Costello, an economist for Real Capital Analytics, a firm that has run a baseline analysis on existing development in the zones.

The zones were chosen by state governors with wide discretion. Only 25 percent of eligible zones got the nod. For example, in Kentucky seven of the 18 poorest census tracts in Louisville were not chosen, according to Tim Weaver, an assistant professor at SUNY Albany who wrote a book on the effectiveness of Empowerment and Enterprise Zones.

""If the key goal was to reduce poverty this was not the proper vehicle,"" said Weaver. ""It's like opening a fancy restaurant and giving the leftovers to the poor.""

The Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development shared a statement with NBC News saying to select their state's zones they used a mapping tool and formally invited input from local stakeholders for consideration.

In Maryland, a spokesperson for Gov. Larry Hogan said the governor's office received suggestions from 12 counties as well as local officials and developers. The spokesperson said all of the state's zones are low-income.

In New Jersey, ""the selection of the zones was done through an objective, transparent and rigorous process based on a formula,"" said a spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy, adding that the governor's office weighed income, unemployment rates and existing neighborhood investments.

Current property owners in zones might also see a boost in property values, ""The owners of these assets might see a bit of a windfall even if they do not go through the whole process to redevelop and deploy capital from a qualified fund themselves,"" says Costello. ""Suddenly the assets may look a little more valuable given the fact that there are more potential buyers looking at these areas.""

The Kushner family and the Trump Organization can't take direct advantage of the tax break for the properties they owned in New Jersey and Maryland before the tax bill passed. However, if they had pre-existing permits to build a new development on the property, then they could start an opportunity zone fund to build and operate the building and that structure could qualify, according to tax experts.

For outside investors, property inside the zones may become more attractive.

For example, an investor could build a new restaurant on Trump's golf course as a separate business and that could qualify.

""This is a way to avoid having to ever recognize gain on an accretion of wealth,"" said Jay Darby, a tax expert from the Sullivan and Worcester law firm, at an investor forum. ""It's a huge deal. It's not a big deal, it's a huge deal.""

The legislation includes no guarantees that the investments will benefit the community. For example, Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings, says the rules would permit an investor to buy 500 acres that had an outhouse on it, double the value of the outhouse and thus qualify the investment as a tax shelter.

Critics say program lacks reporting requirements

For their part, Trump administration officials are maintaining extreme optimism.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin expects $100 billion in new investments, according to an agency press release. ""We want all Americans to experience the dynamic opportunities being generated by President Trump's economic policies,"" Mnuchin said.

HUD Secretary Carson is so confident he often raises the opportunity zone program as a solution to the affordable housing crisis.

At a March hearing, when Carson was asked about a lack of ongoing repairs to crumbling public housing, he responded by talking about the tax benefit. ""You are able to actually pool this capital and that will work extremely well,"" he said. ""And we will already be involved in HUD with many of these redevelopment programs and will be able to guide that funding.""

But there's no indication the government will collect or publish who is investing, what kind of investments are taking place or who the program will impact, according to the Treasury Department, the legislation does not require it.

""I'm taking a wait-and-see attitude,"" said Terry Beach, economic development director for St. Clair County, Illinois, which includes the economically depressed city of East St. Louis. Zones in his county will compete with zones in neighborhoods in Los Angeles and New York. Beach said he recently met with a White House staffer to pitch ideas as to how the program could benefit residents who live in the zones as well as the businesses who invest.

Some low-income housing advocates are doubtful, ""Unless the Treasury Department quickly establishes regulatory guardrails, there is no guarantee that low-income people will benefit in any significant way — if at all — from opportunity zones,"" said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Sen. Cory Booker, D.-N.J., says the bill was supposed to have reporting requirements.

Booker wrote the original bill with Sen. Tim Scott, R.-S.C., which called for annual data to be collected on the program starting five years after the bill passed.

""As a result of the rushed partisan process to pass the Republican tax bill last December, critical safeguards included in the underlying legislation were dropped,"" the senator said in a statement emailed to NBC News. ""Now [the Treasury Department] must restore and expand upon those guardrails and transparency measures included in the underlying legislation. … [W]e need some basic levels of transparency and reporting.""

Treasury is expected to propose a second set of regulations in the coming months.

A Treasury official tells NBC News that a regulatory hearing on the program is planned for Jan. 10. ""We will carry out the same careful and expeditious process for the second set of proposed regulations,"" said the official.

But Booker is not confident Treasury will put the reporting requirement back in and if Treasury doesn't act, he says he will introduce legislation to fix the bill.

Tax lawyers have already found a workaround to one of the program's few restrictions.

The bill rules out ""sin"" businesses like liquor stores, massage parlors and tanning salons but according to tax experts, there's currently nothing to stop an investor from building or renovating a structure and renting to those businesses. That means a low-income neighborhood chosen as a zone could now be dotted with a new smattering of undesirable storefronts.

""These funds should be accountable for what happens in these communities,"" said Lori Chatman, senior executive vice president of Enterprise Community Investment, a developer of affordable housing. ""We are giving up something as taxpayers — we feel like we should have the benefit of understanding how communities are benefiting from that and right now there is no reporting.""

A White House spokesperson told NBC News, ""Treasury and the White House are still working through all the implementing regulations for Opportunity Zones. We understand the intent of the legislation and will continue to work through these types of details.""

A new tax incentive could carefully guide badly needed investment to America’s poorest places, or it could pour gasoline on markets that are already white hot.

On April 9, the Treasury Department debuted the first details of a new and far-reaching community-based tax incentive. In 18 states, newly designated zones could see a wave of new investment under a little-known provision of the recent tax overhaul. These opportunity zones are designed to lure investment to the nation’s poorest urban, suburban, and rural communities with a powerful tax incentive. By the accounts of some experts, the program could deliver a vital injection to areas that haven’t yet recovered from the Great Recession. Yet it could also fuel gentrification in those communities where too much opportunity, too fast, has led to rapid displacement. Nightmare scenarios under the opportunity zones program would mean tax benefits flowing to the wrong places or paying for the wrong things: Amazon receiving sweeping federal tax benefits to build HQ2 in D.C.’s Shaw neighborhood, for example, or payday lenders expanding their already substantial profile in places such as Louisville.

Or opportunity zones could just be, as critics contend, more of the same: the latest in a long line of economic development incentives that have failed to deliver. It all depends on how it’s implemented. “Amazon HQ2 could figure out a way to make this [incentive] work [for the company’s benefit], potentially,” says Brett Theodos, a principal research associate for the Urban Institute. “Which is why zone selection matters so much. If we get places that really need the investment, it’s more likely those benefits are going to accrue to low- and moderate-income people.” Congress created the bipartisan opportunity zones program as part of the tax bill passed last December. It’s an effort to try to rip up the stagnant and uneven pattern of economic development across the country, conditions that are dark and worsening. Even as the Department of Treasury confirms the remaining zone designations—for 32 more states, the territories, and the District of Columbia—leaders are hammering out the terms for “opportunity funds,” vehicles that will allow investors to defer their tax liability by investing equity into a number of different kinds of assets within a community. Final nominations for opportunity zones were due to Treasury on April 20. The test of this program may be two-fold: first, whether cities and states pick the right places to be opportunity zones; and second, whether their federal partners set the proper guidelines for transparency and accountability.

Across the nation, a huge gob of census tracts were eligible to be designated opportunity zones—41,201 in all. (That’s a bit more than half of all the census tracts in the country.) State and territorial governors (plus the mayor of D.C.) were limited to picking just one-quarter of their eligible tracts to be opportunity zones. Unlike with Empowerment Zones, a more top-down Clinton-era predecessor, opportunity zones leave a great deal of discretion to state and local leaders as to where to steer the incentive.

“We don’t have a lack of capital in the U.S. We have a lack of connectivity,” says Bruce Katz, who until recently served as a scholar for the Brookings Institution. “We have a matching problem. This incentive might accelerate our ability to match up.” Katz is not a disinterested observer. He recently teamed up with Jeremy Nowak—a fellow at Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation and Katz’s co-author for The New Localism: How Cities Thrive in the Age of Populism—to launch a consultancy related to opportunity zones. This work is taking them across the country to talk with leaders and investors alike about the program. Consider them matchmakers. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... In Louisville, for example, that might mean turning an under-used high school into a vocational training facility. That’s one idea for an investment opportunity in Louisville’s historically black, near-downtown neighborhood of Russell, where Katz says he talked about the possibility with a school superintendent. A program to boost on-boarding makes sense for Russell (and for Louisville, and for Kentucky as a whole, and really, for America). The idea is that new investments will work hand-in-hand with other factors—assets, existing programs, benefits, local conditions—to generate new jobs and also produce new skilled workers to fulfill those jobs. Below is a map showing Louisville’s opportunity zones, courtesy of a tool built by Enterprise Community Partners. The opportunity zones designated by the state appear in orange. Russell, just west of downtown Louisville and across the highway that segregates the city racially and economically, is among the designated zones. Other areas that meet the main criteria for eligibility but haven’t been designated are shown in blue. These are Low Income Community census tracts: areas with either a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a median family income less than or equal to 80 percent of the area median income. Some tracts are eligible because they are adjacent to Low Income Community census tracts, even though they don’t have quite the same poverty profile; rendered in green, these contiguous tracts can make up only 5 percent of a state’s nominated zones. (Another 200 select tracts around the nation with especially high migration rates or low population levels were also granted special eligibility.)

In a month, Treasury will release the final opportunity zones. These designations will last a decade, meaning that decisions by state and local leaders will determine the fate of the federal program. That’s key in differentiating opportunity zones from the New Markets Tax Credit: Local governments get say. Only one-quarter of eligible tracts will be open to opportunity funds. Local stakeholders’ decisions in choosing between qualifying tracts will be especially consequential. “There’s a lot of variation in how much capital the qualifying census tracts are accessing,” says Theodos, who led a project at the Urban Institute to show where opportunity zones could do the most good (and where they might not). “That means that some places need the incentive more than others, and that ranges of course across place as well. The governors have a lot to choose from, and their choice matters quite a bit.” The program’s authors say that opportunity zones can offset a tilted economy. At a time when inequality is practically a new national anthem, access to capital is especially skewed, geographically. Whole swaths of the nation have seen a decline in large banks lending to small businesses or opening new branches. Smaller and regional banks have struggled to keep up with the majors (or they’ve been absorbed by them). In some places, banking disparities are the result of racial discrimination, while other areas are just being left behind.

At the growth end of the spectrum, venture capital is highly concentrated in a handful of metro areas, and so is high-wage job growth. Sacramento, Philadelphia, Buffalo, and Hartford have lost high-wage jobs to Austin, Nashville, and Denver. Growth in places hit hardest by the Great Recession—in cities such as St. Louis, New Orleans, Rochester, Columbus, and beyond—is mostly confined to low-wage sectors. “Given the trends we’re seeing in the economy, this is the right time and a necessary time to be reevaluating the policy toolkit that we use to address economic disparity at the community level and the regional level,” says John Lettieri, cofounder and president of the Economic Innovation Group, the think tank that helped to write the legislation. “The toolkit we use now does not equip us very well to deal with the trends that we’re seeing, which don’t look anything like the trends we saw in the 1990s or 2000s.” Here’s how the incentive works: Individual or corporate investors can defer their capital gains on investments in opportunity funds for a certain number of years (and in limited cases, permanently). The asset classes in opportunity funds are broad and flexible, with few set parameters: think affordable housing, real estate, infrastructure, and even transit. Cities, suburbs, rural enclaves, and regions can establish their own opportunity funds to identify needs ranging from hyperlocal (small businesses) to intra-state (transit).

The new tax incentive is not a strategy by itself, Lettieri says. The fact that states need to “down select”—or narrow down a list of many eligible tracts to final nominated zones—was baked into the legislation. The program will only work as well as local and state leaders plan it to work. There’s nothing preventing a state from parceling out its opportunity zone incentives to places that are already gentrifying, as appears to be the case in Cleveland. “The opportunity zone incentive is not a silver bullet,” says Steve Glickman, cofounder and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group. Cities like Louisville have a few different kinds of urban markets to consider. There’s the medical district on the east end of downtown, which works like an innovation district. There’s the area of the city near the University of Louisville that has a strong engineering focus. The near-in but economically fenced-off west end is another typology—but it’s an area that the market has historically ignored or discounted or failed to appreciate. The promise of opportunity zones is that self-selecting communities can identify their assets and signal their potential to investors. An opportunity fund that drives investment into small businesses and real estate into neighborhoods like Russell in Louisville could be a model for opportunity zones in other cities that are similar to Russell (and vice versa). The same way that innovation districts and anchor institutions resemble one another (as markets) from one city to the next, so will the to-be-determined opportunities in distressed communities—from South Bend to Louisville to St. Louis and beyond.

“[The market]’s going to begin to understand that the country has these typologies, has these categories, of different kinds of geographies and assets which then lend themselves to certain kinds of investment,” Katz says. “It’s not like, at the end of the day, we’re dealing with hundreds of radically different kinds of propositions. I think this is going to be a market that routinizes.” Kentucky’s opportunity zones cluster in urban tracts in Louisville, Lexington, Bowling Green, and outside Cincinnati. But many more eligible tracts (and opportunity zones) fall in exurban and rural areas—places where the reach of banks is declining, job growth has fallen off, and home mortgages are more likely to be under water. Much more of the country looks like these places than like the white-hot markets of Boston, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Whether the opportunity zones program can avoid the mistakes of “empowerment zones” and other place-based incentives depends on what places leaders pick. In Texas, for example, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg submitted 27 tracts for consideration to the state: a few downtown but most of them stretching further out into Bexar County. (Texas Governor Greg Abbott included 24 of them in the state’s final 628 nominations.) Knowing whether Nirenberg called it right means weighing a host of thorny factors related to race, class, blight, potential employment centers, and more. Socioeconomic change red flags For the Urban Institute, Theodos’s team charted various kinds of capital flows for every eligible opportunity zone tract out there. The project assigned each tract an investment score, a value based on four factors: commercial lending, multifamily lending, single-family lending, and small-business lending. Tracts with a high ratio of investment in one or all these categories earned a high investment score. At such a small geographic level, a high score can sometimes reflect a skewed reality: a concentrated share of low-income housing, for example, or a prison construction project.

Theodos also generated a “socioeconomic change flag” as a measure of demographic change in every tract. Put simply, it’s an indicator for gentrification. Tracts that earned a flag have showcased enough socioeconomic growth already that they don’t need economic stabilization. For these neighborhoods, opportunity zone designation could mean property tax shocks, luxury development, displacement, and all the other undesirable effects of geographic disparity that the program is trying to solve. In Louisville, the census tract that matches up with Russell—where investment might take the form of a new vocational school—has an investment score of 9 (out of 10). That means a high level of existing investment, mostly in small businesses (which may reflect the $29.5 million that the neighborhood received through another federal program, the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative). Only one of the eligible tracts for Jefferson County (i.e., Louisville) earned a socioeconomic change flag, the gentrification bat-signal in Theodos’s analysis. Kentucky leaders skipped this tract, although they designated almost all of its neighbors as opportunity zones. In some urban areas, it may be hard to designate opportunity zones without running the risk of transforming the neighborhood. For example, nearly every census tract in Baltimore City qualifies as an eligible low income tract, but large parts of Baltimore definitely do not lack for private investment. By the Urban Institute’s measure, nearly 20 percent of Baltimore City tracts are already gentrifying. A tax incentive for investors to build up areas like Fells Point or Station North—the places where investors are happily building already— will do the opposite of what the program’s framers intended.

“Those communities that have experienced a lot of social change, it may well be that low- and moderate-income residents are not able to remain and benefit from the incentive,” Theodos says. Treasury has not yet released Maryland’s designations. Same with Washington, D.C., a unique city-state with no rural areas within its 68-square-mile boundaries. Almost half of the District’s opportunity zone–eligible tracts got Urban’s gentrifying marker. The new tax incentive could carefully guide investment toward the parts of the city where it is still badly needed, or it could pour gasoline on a market that’s already white hot. “I think it’s all over the place. I saw a few instances in which states seemed really sophisticated and knew what they were doing,” Nowak says. “They’re grappling particularly with what urban areas can grow, and really grappling with the rural issues, which are really hard. Then I saw other examples where states just said, ‘Give us your tracts, we’ll use those and see if we can get them all in.’” A federalist approach Even as the administration is still mapping out where the nation’s opportunity zones will go, policymakers and stakeholders are puzzling out what opportunity funds will mean to investors. Lettieri and Glickman say that the breadth of possibility for Opportunity fund investments is critical to ensuring that it works as an incentive for struggling communities across urban, suburban, and rural settings. The same tax incentive might build workforce development in rural Appalachia or affordable housing in downtown Atlanta.

“If these projects are used broadly to accomplish social good, to build affordable housing, to create new businesses and help businesses expand, then this program will be able to create a new ecosystem of community development financial institutions and equity investors coming together to support businesses and developers to do work,” Theodos says. “Alternatively, if it’s used by payday lenders to grow their payday footprint, that might have a different effect on the local community,” he adds. But the upside is substantial, too. Nothing in the U.S. serves quite the same role as, say, Sweden’s Kommunivest, a consortium that enables municipal governments to raise capital by issuing green bonds. Done right, opportunity zones could serve an unfulfilled intermediary role between capital and places where capital has evaporated. The problem is larger than a missed marketplace opportunity. Economic anxiety in America is linked to sincere systemic problems, from lifetime earnings gaps to lower childhood achievement gaps to higher suicide rates. “Worst of all, the longer the unemployment spell, the less likely the possibility of reemployment—and by extension the opportunity to escape these terrible costs—becomes,” reads a white paper by Jared Bernstein and Kevin A. Hassett. The Economic Innovation Group released the bipartisan paper in 2015 as its mission statement for opportunity zones. Depending on what local and state leaders do with it, the program may exacerbate some of the problems stemming from growth in high-octane areas. But there are worse problems, and those are the ones that opportunity zones were designed to target. “I think cities, counties, and states are grownups,” Katz says. “Let’s take [this program] at its word and see if we can—in a classic, American, federalist, distributed way—figure it out.”",0,0,0,https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/04/can-opportunity-zones-save-the-country/558266/
hartfordbusiness,"Amid skeptics, CT bets ‘Opportunity Zones’ spur economic development","The blue highlighted areas on the map depict Connecticut communities the state Department of Economic and Community Development has pitched to the U.S. Treasury for eligibility as Opportunity Zones.

The United Technology Research Center in East Hartford sits in one of the myriad “Enterprise Zones’’ in Connecticut, which are decades-old, state-funded cousins to newly created federal “Opportunity Zones.”

Connecticut rarely misses a chance to avail itself of state and federal initiatives aimed at benefiting the most economically distressed communities and neighborhoods among its 169 cities and towns.

In 1982, it was the first to embrace state-generated ""Enterprise Zones,'' or EZs, that offered local, five-year property-tax breaks and other benefits to investors/developers to spur housing and jobs, among other private investment. According to the state Department of Economic and Community Development, there are 10 types of EZs in 43 participating communities, up from six initially.

A decade later, ""Empowerment Zones'' were spawned also to encourage urban and rural development using tax incentives and grants to reward investors otherwise unwilling to risk pumping capital into redeveloping struggling neighborhoods or regions.

Now, a third, federally sponsored private-investment subsidy, known as ""Opportunity Zones'' (OZs), has arrived, offering to trim federal capital-gains taxes for up to a decade to qualified ""opportunity fund'' investors who potentially could unleash an estimated $6 trillion of private investment into needy U.S. communities, experts say. Opportunity funds are private investment vehicles subject to federal capital-gains tax benefits.

Connecticut has applied to the U.S. Treasury to qualify 72 low-income neighborhoods in 27 municipalities as OZs, according to the state Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD). Nominees include areas in Hartford, East Hartford, Meriden, Middletown, West Hartford and Manchester, among others. Treasury is not expected to formally issue its OZ rules and guidelines until fall.

But amid limited noteworthy examples locally and nationally of the positive economic contributions from EZs and Empowerment Zones, some question whether OZs will have much impact.

Brett Theodos, senior researcher for the nonpartisan Urban Institute in Washington D.C., describes OZs as ""a very flexible tool meant to extend investment into communities of need.'' OZs, Theodos said, are intended to spur a wide menu of community and neighborhood investment, such as opening a supermarket, a gas station, or a bank.

Based on the collective checkered performance of Enterprise and Empowerment zones to date, Theodos says it's an open question whether OZs and their investors can deliver.

""I'm not sure,'' he said, noting the Urban Institute neither endorses nor refutes OZs. ""It remains to be seen. It's so new and open-ended, none of us knows how this will play out.''

Timothy J. Bartik, senior economist at W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., says most of the analyses of EZs across the U.S. discovered they ""don't necessarily do any more in luring private investment than non-Enterprise Zones.''

""There's very little impact,"" Bartik said.

The reason is, he said, that tax-incentivized private capital, coupled with government low-interest loans and grants cannot overcome more systemic issues — lack of education and job skills, weak housing and infrastructure, and high crime rates — plaguing many American communities and neighborhoods.

Moreover, U.S. communities that have drawn past EZ investment, and more likely to appeal right away to OZ investors, are typically attractive, low-risk environments that likely would have drawn private investment without public incentives.

The key to Connecticut making the most of OZs, Bartik said, is how and where the state chooses neighborhoods for OZ inclusion. Also, the state must commit to tracking and analyzing whether or not OZ investment funds and their investors are delivering on their obligations.

Connecticut’s hopeful

As expected, chiefs of local and state economic-development and housing agencies are high on OZs' potential to augment Connecticut's aggressive use of low-interest, forgivable ""First Five"" and Small Business Express loans and grants to encourage existing businesses to stay and grow jobs, while luring out-of-state and foreign employers to open or relocate here.

DECD Commissioner Catherine Smith says OZs could widen the spigot for more regional and national capital to flow into Connecticut residential-commercial development projects.

""We have talked to a few [opportunity] funds that are trying to figure out how to play in this new sandbox,'' Smith said, declining to identify them.

The U.S. Treasury will manage the OZ program and is working to put in place a program infrastructure, authorities say. Meantime, officials say Connecticut's housing agency, along with the state's Green Bank energy-ecology arm and its Connecticut Innovations technology-promotions arm, too, are exploring how to leverage any eventual OZ capital.

""I definitely see opportunity,'' said state Department of Housing Commissioner Evonne Klein. ""By participating in this, this is certainly a piece of Connecticut's economic recovery.''

Klein said OZs offer potential to supplement Connecticut's huge, $1 billion public investment under Gov. Dannel P. Malloy to renovate or create 20,000 more units of affordable-living units statewide.

Michael Freimuth is executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority in Hartford and an economic-development veteran with experience overseeing two EZs in Stamford and Bridgeport.

""The beauty of enterprise zones was that … tax discounts are there as long as you are eligible,'' Freimuth said. ""The problem with enterprise zones is that it's much more complicated in order to make a business succeed than just taxes. The condition of the properties, the greater costs of urban enterprise (higher insurance costs for instance) and the general obsolescence of the facilities creates diseconomies.""

""Opportunity Zones on the other hand, go to the return on investment, increasing the ability/willingness for risk-taking,"" he said. ""Whether the edge is taken off to a better degree with this mechanism than that available in an Enterprise Zone will have to be seen.''

While CRDA is not linked to any in-state EZs, Freimuth says OZs' tax-deferral structure could assist it and investors in handling the toughest part of any redevelopment deal — assembling the ""capital stack.'' That is, packaging loans, tax credits, equity and other capital to cover projects' development and operating costs.

With OZs, CRDA could expect increased equity for projects in OZ areas that should make CRDA neighborhood projects more profitable and less debt dependent, Freimuth said. That, in turn, could lower the CRDA subsidy and spread the program to more deals. CRDA's OZ opportunities are likely to be housing-related neighborhood investments, he said.",2018,05,14,http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/20180514/PRINTEDITION/305109941/amid-skeptics-ct-bets-
marketplace,"The U.S. tries to boost poor neighborhoods, again. Will it work this time?","The one-time Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, has been turned into a seven-story research lab. - Marketplace

Listen To The Story Marketplace Embed Code <iframe src=""https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/26/economy/scheme-bring-investment-low-income-areas/popout"" frameborder=""0"" width=""100%"" height=""240px""></iframe>

In the Washington Heights neighborhood of upper Manhattan, there’s an old theater that feels stranded in time.

The Audubon Ballroom, built in 1912, features grand columns and intricate carvings of Roman gods on its facade. The ballroom was a vaudeville theater, then a movie theater. But its place in history was solidified in the 1960s: Malcolm X was assassinated while speaking at the Audubon Ballroom on Feb. 21, 1965.

In the 1990s, Columbia University wanted to tear down the Audubon to build lab space for its growing hospital and medical school. Columbia had been eyeing the property for years, but the Audubon was now inside a newly created “Empowerment Zone,” and building there would be suddenly much cheaper.

The Empowerment Zone was the latest iteration of a decades-old idea that places suffering from persistent poverty could be turned around with incentives to bring in private investment and business development.

With the passage of the new tax law, the idea has surfaced again.

State governments are currently in the process of nominating “Opportunity Zones,” low-income areas, which, if approved, would qualify for capital gains tax incentives as a means to bring in private investment.

The problem is that such programs have been tried and proven ineffective for nearly 40 years. While they might bring wealth to poor areas, they don’t generally create wealth within the areas. The wealth trickles up rather than down.

Why try again?

“The reason why we see the tax code acting as a vehicle for so much policy is because there’s reluctance to have government programs that actually transfer money to the people and places that need them,” says Rachel Weber, professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

So if the poor don’t benefit greatly from programs like the Empowerment Zone or Opportunity Zone, who does?

“Folks looking to reduce their tax liability are going to do well,” Weber said. “High-net-worth individuals who can personally benefit from a deferment or deferral of their capital gains tax. Also, potentially, developers interested in building in places where there may be an additional subsidy.”

She added that a cottage industry of professionals who specialize in the arcane rules, regulations and tax code minutiae of programs such as these has sprung up and also stands to benefit.

“The Opportunity Zone, like the Enterprise Zone or the Empowerment Zone before it, is really a zombie policy, staggering on for decades despite its moribund performance,” said Tim Weaver, assistant professor of urban policy and politics at the State University of New York in Albany and author of ""Blazing the Neoliberal Trail: Urban Political Development in the United States and United Kingdom.""

Weaver believes the new Opportunity Zone program will be even less effective than the '90s-era Empowerment Zones, because it doesn’t include that program’s direct cash grants or local hiring requirements.

Steve Glickman of Economic Innovation Group, who helped design the new program, said states and cities are free to create any requirements they wish to ensure the programs works best in their own communities.

He understands that cutting taxes for investors may not be the most direct way to help the poor. But, he said, “if you’re poor in a poor community, there’s no hope. If you’re poor in a prosperous community, you’re many more times more likely to climb the socioeconomic ladder.”

Economic research supports this. But Kimberley Johnson, a New York University professor of social and cultural analysis, said addressing the underlying inequality would do even more to help the poor.

Columbia University ultimately got its wish at the Audubon Ballroom. It was turned into a seven-story research lab. The facade of the ballroom was preserved, with the idea that it would be turned into a museum and cultural space. But on a recent day, would-be visitors couldn't get past the locked doors during posted visiting hours. A passerby mentions that the space is rarely open, perhaps twice a month.

“That’s really telling,” said Johnson, who attended Columbia in the '90s. “This was a space that was supposed to be for the community, and it’s not really accessible.”

While many workers in the building are white-collar transplants employed by the medical lab, it does seem as though the local hiring requirement was fulfilled. There’s a locally owned Caffe X on the premises, serving fresh pastries and hot coffee.

“Is that what Malcolm X would have envisioned?” Johnson asked. “Probably not, but it’s nice, I guess.”

Proposed by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the provision allows governors to select certain census tracts in their states, in economically distressed areas, as “opportunity zones.” The Treasury certified the last of these zones in June, bringing the total number to 8,700. Now, investors who fund projects in these areas will get sizable tax breaks—even on unrelated investments. As long as they dump profits into a fund earmarked for the opportunity zones, they can defer or even eliminate the capital gains they would otherwise have owed.

Some of the census tracts that have been identified as opportunity zones may be truly distressed. But it’s dubious whether others should qualify—this summer, for example, much of Long Island City in New York was named an opportunity zone. Now that Amazon has announced it’s moving one of its two HQ2 branches there, the retail behemoth could nab a $225 million tax break simply because the site happens to fall in one such zone—this, on top of the $1.7 billion New York has already offered Amazon. Investors who purchase apartment buildings for the influx of tech employees will also see tax breaks. So will anyone building office parks, or grocery stores. That money may well be better spent elsewhere, but during the debate over the tax bill, such questions received very little attention. Neither, really, did the zones themselves. Since its passage, though, President Donald Trump has enthusiastically promoted the plan, issuing press releases boasting that “new investment will flow into blighted developments, stalled infrastructure projects, and other desperately needed economic enhancements” and create fiscal improvements that will “help turn dreams to reality.”

The thinking behind the zones reflects Republican faith in privatization as a cure-all. If Trump has departed from conservative orthodoxy on trade and entitlements, he is squarely with the party when it comes to this issue. On the campaign trail, he promised to spend $1.5 trillion on the country’s infrastructure, but when the details of his plan were released a month before the election, it was merely a proposal to privatize roads, bridges, and waterways. Trump has similar plans for the nation’s air traffic control system, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and even the Postal Service. Each one offers huge upsides for a select group of financiers and business owners, but does little to nothing for the American people.

None of these promises has fully gone into law—apart from opportunity zones, the first of which the Treasury implemented this spring. Since then, a number of funds have cropped up to cash in on the boom. Anthony Scaramucci, who served as Trump’s director of communications for all of ten days, plans to launch a $3 billion “opportunity fund” at his hedge fund Skybridge Capital. Cadre, the real estate crowdfunding platform partially owned by Jared Kushner and his brother, Joshua, is also focused on exploiting the zones. As Charles Clinton, the CEO of EquityMultiple, a real estate investment startup, said in September, they are “one of the biggest real estate investment opportunities in decades.”

economist,Bringing investment to poor places,"C ENSUS TRACT three in Cumberland County, Maine covers part of the city of Portland, named America’s top food destination by Bon Appétit magazine. Its dock is the landing spot for an expected 200,000 tourists this year. Yet Census Tract Three has also been designated as an opportunity zone, America’s favourite new policy for increasing investment in poor places.

These zones are part of last year’s tax cut. The policy tempts investors to put their money into poor areas with generous tax incentives. It allows investors to defer tax on any unrealised capital gains they reinvest in the zones. If the resulting investment is held for seven years, 15% of that original capital-gains liability is written off. And if the investment is held for more than ten years, any associated capital gains tax due on gains during that decade is waived. The scope of the policy, as well as its cost in foregone tax revenue, is vast: nearly 35m Americans live in places designated as opportunity zones.

Investors are salivating. On November 10th Anthony Scaramucci, President Donald Trump’s one-time adviser, announced he would be starting a real-estate fund to invest in the zones. Boosters point to the trillions of dollars of unrealised capital gains ready to be unlocked, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, has speculated that as much as $100bn could flow in to the 8,761 zones. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that it will cost $1.6bn over their ten-year forecasting window. But as the scheme is uncapped, the final amount could be much larger than that.

Plenty of policy wonks like place-based policies in theory, because they worry that poor parts of America now find it harder and harder to catch up with rich ones. In theory, geographically targeted tax cuts or subsidies could encourage new clusters of economic activity to form, thereby lifting depressed places.

But getting good results, or good evidence, is not so straightforward. Earlier place-based policies have been difficult to evaluate, in part because some were tried in areas that would probably have recovered without them. They also have tended to be multi-pronged, making it difficult to know what precisely has generated any success. In 1994 Congress created a number of Empowerment Zones, offering both grants and tax breaks for employers, in places with high poverty or which had suffered a lot of emigration. This appears to have raised employment and wages in these places. More recently, the New Markets Tax Credit has handed tax credits to investors in certain areas. One study published in 2012 found the scheme raised employment and lowered poverty a bit in the affected places. Vetting was stringent: only 16% of applications for the credit between 2003 and 2017 were successful.

The other evidence is mixed. Enterprise Zones in Britain and France, for example, offered tax breaks to businesses operating in certain areas and appear to have raised employment, but at the expense of areas nearby. The European Union doles out “structural funds” for investment in poorer regions, which seem to raise local output and employment, but there are questions over how lasting their effects are. In America state and local governments compete with each other to attract business by offering packages of tax cuts, and it seems that successful bids do deliver benefits to the local community. But there is little evidence to suggest that this is much more than a zero-sum game between places.

Opportunity zones differ from these earlier attempts, in that they come with very few conditions. Investors will be free of any kind of approval process. There are some restrictions on what counts as a qualifying investment. Golf courses and massage parlours are out. Real-estate developers must make “substantial improvement” to a property within 30 months of buying it, equivalent to doubling the value of any pre-existing buildings. The law is not supposed to be for investment in mega-corporations either. To qualify, companies that receive investment must have at least 50% of their activity and 70% of their physical capital in a zone. But relative to comparable schemes there are very few strings attached.

One concern is that investors will pocket tax rewards for investments that they would have made anyway. The benefit to locals may not be worth the cost of the forgone federal tax revenue, which could otherwise be used for different things. Then there is the matter of creating a new, open-ended tax break for investors, who are usually the wealthiest Americans.

The Maine chance

Portland’s Census Tract Three, and other places like it, offer a warning. Ideally tax credits would do the most good in areas that were not showing signs of revival on their own. A study by Hilary Gelfond and Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, found that 89% of selected opportunity zones do have poverty rates higher than the national average. But when selecting census tracts to be opportunity zones, most states picked places that were more likely to show signs of gentrification than eligible ones that were passed over. In such cases, it seems right to ask how much investment taking advantage of the tax break might have happened anyway.

Doug Ray, who helped Maine’s governor, Paul LePage, to draw up that state’s list of places, explains that to be picked as one of the opportunity zones, it helped to have sites ready for investment, as well as an adequate supply of workers and housing. “A lot of areas that are eligible are where investors would not probably want to put money,” he says.

Perhaps the most worrying element of the policy is that it will be fiendishly difficult ever to know whether it has succeeded or has just been a gigantic waste of money. So far it is unclear whether the government will track how opportunity-zone funds are used. If state and local governments simply use them to turbocharge existing development policies, or are forced to harness the incoming investment by offering even more tax incentives, then isolating their impact will be even harder.

The scheme is still in its infancy. The first batch of Treasury regulations was released on October 19th, and another is due later this year. John Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group, a think-tank and advocate of the zones, says that “there’s a failure of imagination about what this could be if it’s done well.” For the moment, though, scepticism is in order.",2018,11,17,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/11/17/bringing-investment-to-poor-places

tpr,San Antonio Named Country's First Military Spouse Economic Empowerment Zone,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s initiative Hiring Our Heroes announced San Antonio as the country’s first Military Spouse Economic Empowerment Zone on Tuesday.

Business, civic and military communities in the area will partner to create an employment network that targets military spouses. Stakeholders include USAA, Joint Base San Antonio and the Military Officers Association of America.

Military spouses face an uphill battle for employment, with frequent moves disrupting their linear progression in the workplace and making it harder for them to keep jobs.

“Military spouses in the San Antonio area and around the country represent a highly educated and skilled pool of applicants who, despite their skills, continue to face significant rates of unemployment and underemployment,” said Eric Eversole, president of Hiring Our Heroes and vice president at the Chamber.

Elizabeth O’Brien, director of Hiring Our Heroes’ military spouse program, said local need is hard to measure, in part because military families move so regularly.

“It really varies installation to installation,” O’Brien said. “Parts of Joint Base San Antonio are (training focused), so often the tour is shorter than normal. Some spouses aren’t actually moving to the area. So it’s difficult to put a specific number on it.”

Other statistics indicate that military spouses nationwide are unemployed at a rate of 16 percent, four times the rate of their civilian counterparts.

O’Brien said hiring managers should take a broader view of military candidates, one that puts spouses front and center.

""You know, we hear a lot about military-friendly, veteran-friendly companies. It needs to be military ready,” she said. “Part of that is getting military spouses out of the fine print. When I go to your website, it shouldn't take two, three, four clicks to find out that you're hiring military spouses.""

City Councilman Greg Brockhouse challenged local businesses to actively recruit military spouses.

""We at the City Council, the mayor, myself and all my peers are going to ask you to open your eyes and give that one extra special shot to somebody who's already serving their country. And that's a military spouse,”

Because San Antonio’s Military Spouse Economic Empowerment Zone is so new, its partnering organizations are still figuring out how to measure success, according to Richard Perez, president of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce.

“That’s going to be a challenge, because we don’t know who is hiring,” he said. “So, while we can encourage and guide, we really don’t have a database to track participation and hiring practices. We’re relying on businesses to self-report to us. So that’s probably the best we’re going to do right now.”

When asked whether local businesses are being incentivized to hire military spouses, Perez said there are efforts underway.

“There’s no incentive now,” he said. “But we’ve talked about, at the federal level, some kind of a tax credit or something that could motivate a business or entice them on the front end. Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to crack that nut yet, but we’re working on it.”

The Military Spouse Economic Empowerment Zone program grew out of a 2017 study by the Chamber, which found that the majority of employed military spouses said that having dual incomes was vitally important to their family, though only 50 percent of the military families surveyed reported having dual-income status. The study also found that the resulting financial strain can influence service members in their decision to stay in the military.

Seven more zones will be announced in the coming months.

chalkbeat,A national consultant and a charter group want to give Adams 14 schools more autonomy,"Internally rating schools, giving them more autonomy, and letting a charter organization turn around at least two schools — approaches that are common in school turnaround work but that might be controversial in Adams 14 — are among the ideas that one applicant has proposed in seeking to manage the troubled Adams 14 school district.

The application from District Renaissance Partners, submitted jointly by a national consultant and a local charter organization, also proposes creating a new community board to oversee the district’s improvement.

“That’s what’s different about this proposal, this new structure,” said Brett Alessi, a co-founder of Empower Schools, the national consultant. “We don’t do takeover, we do partnerships. We thought this was an opportunity to be able to do that.”

External manager finalists Read about each of the other four finalists and their applications. On Mapleton Public Schools here.

On Schools Cubed here.

On MGT Consulting Group here.

The group is among four finalists to become an external manager for Adams 14. Finalists will be interviewed this weekend by a community group, and then the school board plans to make a selection Feb. 12. The state, which ordered the district to hire an external manager, will then have to approve that pick.

The proposals don’t come with price tags, so the district will have to choose without knowing how much a manager will cost. That negotiation will come after the district, and state, approve the best manager.

In narrowing the nine manager applications to four finalists, community reviewers considered applicants’ ability to understand and work with a diverse community like Adams 14, and their track record of managing school districts.

Leaders of Empower Schools oversaw a high-profile district turnaround in Lawrence, Massachusetts. A few months ago, when Adams 14 officials asked the state education department for examples of external management structures, experts pointed to the Lawrence turnaround.

While Empower’s co-founders including Alessi have district management experience predating Empower, most of the group’s experience is in school turnaround.

Most of Empower’s experience involved improving schools by creating “innovation zones,” where clusters of schools have autonomy from district rules or union contracts, similar to what charter schools have.

Alessi said his proposal makes up for some of that lack of experience managing whole districts by partnering with the charter management organization Third Future Schools, led by Mike Miles.

Miles spent three years as superintendent of Dallas schools, where he made headlines for creating new evaluations for teachers and principals and for firing three principals after the district’s school board voted to keep them.

Before Dallas, Miles served as superintendent of the Harrison School District in Colorado Springs for six years. In that role, he led the district to adopt one of the first teacher pay-for-performance models in the state that tied salary and raises to annual evaluations.

The Adams 14 proposal would have Miles’ group operate two existing district schools and possibly expand to four in the third year. The schools wouldn’t necessarily be converted to charters, but leaders would look into giving them state “innovation status,” which would grant the schools flexibility in some rules so they could expand hours, or hire and fire teachers, for instance.

“Our initial thought is to do an innovation zone, but maybe there’s also a hybrid model,” Miles said. “I don’t want to get ahead of the process.”

The two schools would follow the same model for serving at-risk students as the other charter schools Miles operates. They would be open from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. to accommodate working parents, they would call on community experts to teach non-academic electives, and would use a model of “personalized learning,” that often relies on technology to let students work at their own pace.

A community board named later and district staff could help decide which schools Miles’ group would manage and which would undergo other strategies for improvement.

In the model, Alessi said, the board wouldn’t replace the district’s board of education, but would serve as the contracting entity with Adams 14, instead of Empower or Third Future Schools.

That new board, likely with nine members, would be “responsible for ensuring all partners, including District Renaissance Partners, deliver on their contracted responsibilities.”

Together the approach Empower and Third Future Schools propose includes many of the pieces that would be considered part of a “portfolio model” for schools — where the district offers families more school choices, creates a system to rate schools, and give schools more flexibility.

Asked whether the goal was to create a portfolio model similar to Denver’s, Alessi instead called it “educator empowerment.”

“We would certainly move toward educator empowerment, empowering educators at the school level,” Alessi said. “It would not be a top-down approach.”

Empower Schools is a member of Education Cities, a national group that connects organizations that push for school autonomy and the portfolio model.

The idea of choice is not unpopular in Adams 14, but the idea of closing schools, creating charter schools, and bringing in outsiders can be.

Barb McDowell, a teacher and president of the teachers union in Adams 14, said many teachers and administrators are questioning why any large consulting group would want to take on the work of fixing schools in the district, and whether they can handle the work.

“They don’t know the district,” McDowell said. “They don’t know the community.”

Alessi acknowledged that the biggest challenge for the team he is proposing to bring to Adams 14 will be bringing the community together and making sure people support the plan. He said he hopes the community process to select a manager helps build some buy-in, and then, that the proposed new board helps grow that feeling.

“We know there’s not a single voice for Adams 14,” Alessi said. “I want to make sure as much as possible that the school board and the district feel bought into this.”

nextcity,Big Questions Ahead for New Tax Incentive Targeting Poor Communities,"Amid the scramble to protect community development programs whose funding has already been slashed by Trump Administration budgets and the impact of recent tax cuts, parts of the community development world are now also rushing to get to the table to help shape a new program that could offer a new source of capital for areas of high poverty.

Tucked into the recently passed tax bill, the Investing in Opportunity Act gives chief executives of every U.S. state and territory up to 120 days (starting from December 22, 2017) to designate low-income census tracts in their state as “Opportunity Zones”, eligible to receive badly needed investments. Low-income is defined as a poverty rate of at least 20 percent and median family income up to 80 percent of the area median income.

“So many people are wrestling with the tax bill’s implications for existing tax programs, this new program has gone relatively unnoticed,” says Rachel Reilly Carroll, associate director for impact investing at Enterprise Community Loan Fund.

As a sign of interest in the program no one expected to pass any time soon, around 800 attendees participated in a webinar Enterprise hosted about the program, its largest webinar attendance ever.

So far, at least one state, Missouri, has issued a request for proposals from county and municipal executives to nominate low-income census tracts to become an Opportunity Zone. Each state can choose up to 25 percent of its total low-income census tracts to designate.

If states don’t respond with a selection of census tracts to designate as opportunity zones, they are effectively opting out of the program. The designations will last for ten years.

Some elements of the Opportunity Zones may feel familiar. The Empowerment Zones program took effect under President Clinton, to much fanfare. Under that program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development designated high-poverty areas in six cities as empowerment zones, making them eligible for a range of benefits, like employment tax credits and complementary social service block grants meant for things like job training, business renovations, public safety initiatives, and other services. But the results were not good. About ten years after it was implemented, a Government Accountability Office review found that although improvements in poverty, unemployment, and economic growth had occurred in the empowerment zones, the office could not tie those changes to the empowerment zone designation.

The opportunity zones program is distinct from the empowerment program in a few ways. One key distinction is the designation process—it won’t be limited to a few cities. Instead, since state executives choose low-income census tracts in their states, the program has the potential to be much larger in geographic scope, and it can benefit rural areas as well as urban.

Another distinction is the type of benefit provided. Since it provided employment tax credits to businesses for locating in and hiring residents from within the target zone, the empowerment zone program drew criticism for subsidizing businesses that simply moved from one part of the city to another, instead of producing new jobs.

The Investing in Opportunity Act could still run into that same issue, but it’s less likely since the program doesn’t subsidize businesses directly for doing anything. Instead, it may draw criticism for a different reason — it’s primarily another tax cut for the already wealthy. The act allows investors to defer some of their taxes on capital gains in exchange for investing some of their accumulated wealth into the opportunity zones. Economic Innovation Group, the research and advocacy organization behind the act, estimates that, in the U.S., there are some $2.3 trillion in unrealized capital gains that investors would like to cash in on. The group’s idea was to create an incentive for those dollars to make a stop in low-income communities on the way back into investors’ bank accounts. It would be a big windfall to someone like Napster founder and early Facebook investor Sean Parker, who is a co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group.

Those wealthy investors, however, won’t necessarily be cherry-picking deals. Reminiscent of the federal new markets tax credit program, the Investing in Opportunity Act will set up a distributed decision-making system to determine the program’s pipeline of projects and businesses. While some consider its system to be too costly and cumbersome, the new markets tax credit program has shown better results than the empowerment zones program.

The Investing in Opportunity Act creates “Opportunity Funds,” special investment funds that will be certified by the U.S. Treasury, which will be required to invest at least 90 percent of their investment dollars into businesses or properties located in designated Opportunity Zones.

It is not yet clear whether any existing organizations will automatically qualify as Opportunity Funds. For example, the U.S. Treasury has already certified more than a thousand community development financial institutions, although that certification only requires 60 percent of an institution’s investments be made into low- or moderate- income census tracts. The U.S. Treasury also certifies community development entities which provide access to the new markets tax credit program.

Some advocates see it as a lost opportunity that the Investing in Opportunity Act did not automatically designate minority-depository institutions, which already have a track record of serving many low-income communities, as eligible to receive investment from the program.

It’s still unclear how many states will participate in the program, and how open the process will be to decide which low-income census tracts will get a designation. It’s also unclear whether designated census tracts will be able to absorb whatever new capital that might be made available to them. Another huge question is who will decide how the funds get invested. Finally, there’s no predicting how much money the program will actually raise. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the program would result in a cost of $1.6 billion in deferred tax revenues over ten years, indicating some expected uptake, but there’s no sure way to tell what amount of investment that would represent, since the program rewards investors on a sliding scale—the longer they leave their money invested in opportunity funds, the more in capital gains taxes they can avoid paying in the end. Opportunity funds could end up raising too much capital without enough deals in the designated census tracts, blunting the impact per tax dollar lost, or they could end up without enough capital raised to make a discernible difference.

At least one thing is certain. It will be very flexible capital, not just for housing but for broader uses like small business lending or economic development. “There’s room to create products with the potential to unlock new capital for the broader community development ecosystem,” Reilly Carroll says.",0,0,0,https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/big-questions-ahead-for-new-tax-incentive-targeting-underinvested-communiti

(Photo: City of Abilene)

The Abilene City Council adopted an infill development program at its meeting Thursday night that repeals an existing program.

The changes create what is called the ""Abilene Neighborhood Empowerment Zone,"" which offers economic incentives to promote and encourage new and private business development. It also promotes remodeling and new construction of affordable and market-rate housing options in the city's historic and economically-distressed areas.

During a February retreat, the council identified six goals for city staff, one being infill development.

Mayor Anthony Williams said Abilene had been having a ""20-year conversation about infill, and we've been woefully unsuccessful.""

""I'm excited about what I look at as an opportunity to build a toolbox that can encourage private sector development inside areas that need to be developed,"" he said.

In 2008, the city identified more than 300 acres of vacant lots within the core of the city, Williams said, a number that since has grown.

""I'm anxious to move forward and have conversations about partnering with the private sector to help us address the infill and redevelopment in (our) core,"" he said.

The previous infill policy essentially allowed permit fees to be reduced by 50 percent, said City Manager Robert Hanna.

""In my opinion, we haven't done a good job of advertising this necessarily, and I don't know if the incentives have been enough to generate significant energy,"" Hanna said.

In general, the initial zone is bounded on the east and west borders by the flood plains of Elm and Cedar creeks.

The northern boundary is U.S. Interstate 20, and the southern boundaries are South 7th and South 14th streets, with Butternut Street as the connector.

The new program authorizes the following incentives, with council approval:

For the purpose of benefiting the zone, refunds of municipal sales tax on sales made within the zone, for a period of not more than 10 years.

""So if you're a business and you buy goods and services within the zone, you can be rebated your city portion of those sales tax(es), if that's something you would qualify for,"" Hanna said.

Agreements abating municipal property taxes on property within the zone.

""We will need to adopt a tax abatement policy to do that officially,"" Hanna said.

Setting baseline performance standards, such as the Energy Star Program as developed by the Department of Energy, to encourage the use of alternative building materials that address concerns relating to the environment or to the building costs, maintenance, or energy consumption.

Participation in up to 50 percent of the cost of water or sewer line extensions necessary to serve property being developed in the zone.

""Most of these properties will already have water and sewer mains, but not all of them,"" he said. ""This will allow us to participate if council chose to do so.""

The city may choose to authorize these incentives through a Chapter 380 Economic Development agreement.

According to the Texas comptroller's office, Chapter 380 of the Local Government Code authorizes cities to offer incentives designed to promote economic development, such as commercial and retail projects.

Specifically, it provides for loans and grants of city funds or services at little or no cost to promote state and local economic development and to stimulate business and commercial activity.

""All those tax incentives require council approval,"" Hanna said. ""So staff would have to come to council and form a formal economic development agreement.""

In addition, the changes authorize the city manager to:

Waive or reduce fees related to the construction or remodel of buildings in the zone, including fees related to the inspection of buildings or impact fees.

Authorize the provision of roll-off containers and associated haul-on, haul-off and tipping charges at the city’s actual cost.

Waive or reduce sewer and water tap fees.

Waive or reduce zoning application fees.

The proposed boundaries are not meant to be unalterable but amended to address market opportunities.

Additionally, other zones may need to be established, and some zones may need to be abolished.

""We need to continue to work with the Development Corporation of Abilene and the Abilene Industrial Foundation to develop a program that these incentives would fall under so that businesses would have some certainty,"" Hanna said.

Councilman Bruce Kreitler said he was happy to see the changes.

""I'm glad to see us do this,"" he said. ""My comment about infill development is that we talk about it all the time, but we never do anything that actually attracts it. I don't know that this program is going to be the kickstarter — (but) it could be.""

Hanna said his intention would to be to talk to the building community and building suppliers, getting them ""around the table"" to talk about the program and the city's desire to see infill projects succeed.

""We're just going to have to roll up our sleeves and get to it,"" he said. ""... I think we start with this and go forward and make adjustments as necessary.""

governing,The Tax Reform Program Many Hope Will Revive Distressed Communities,"For decades, the feds have experimented with ways to incentivize investment in the nation’s most distressed communities. Be it empowerment zones in the 1990s or the New Markets Tax Credit in 2000, each effort has tried, but generally failed to combat uneven patterns of economic development across the country.

Now, some say a new program created as part of the federal tax overhaul in December could succeed where the others have faltered.

So-called opportunity zones allow investors to defer their tax liability by investing equity into different assets within a distressed community. It has the potential, says Urban Institute expert Brett Theodos, to be the largest community economic development program in the nation. (Currently, that status belongs to the $3.3 billion Community Development Block Grant program.)

To qualify as an opportunity zone, a census tract must meet certain requirements set forth by the Treasury Department to ensure investments flow to areas with high unemployment and low median incomes. Last week, governors submitted the areas in their state eligible for investment.

Once designated, these areas will be eligible for investment via ""opportunity funds."" It works like this: Private investors who earn money selling stock would normally have to pay a capital gains tax on those earnings. But if they instead take those earnings and invest them in opportunity funds, they can defer taxes on those gains until 2026. What’s more, the longer they keep their investment in the fund, the bigger discount they get when they pay those taxes: up to 15 percent if they keep the investment through the end of 2026.

There's another perk. If investors keep their money in an opportunity fund for at least 10 years, any additional money they make from their fund investment won't be taxed. The idea is to encourage investors to invest for the long haul.

The program is the brainchild of the Economic Innovation Group, which first pushed the free-market idea three years ago in Washington, D.C. To EIG President John Lettieri, opportunity zones address some of the criticisms about prior tax credit programs in that they encourage long-term investment and put the financial risk on the investor. “Unlike other programs, there is no guarantee here,” he says. “If you have losses, there is no benefit. So, you’re not putting full the risk on the taxpayer, but you’re keeping it on investors.”

But, counters Theodos, the concept isn’t totally without risk to the taxpayer and -- like prior versions --doesn’t guarantee the investment will ultimately help communities. “The government is still going to spend a bunch of money,"" he says, and will have no guarantee that the investment will benefit distressed communities. ""I think it remains to be seen how good a deal this is.”

Indeed, it's too soon to know whether the program will be effective or not. But observers are encouraged by early developments, specifically the census tracts selected by governors.

About 57 percent of the country’s neighborhoods meet the criteria to be designated an opportunity zone. Many worried that governors would select only those areas considered safe bets for investors. For example, notes The Boston Globe, neighborhoods in the Boston suburbs of Cambridge, Chelsea and Quincy have been designated as opportunity zones, even as investments in real estate have already been surging in recent years.

But an analysis by the Brookings Institution shows that most states designated deeply impoverished areas for the new subsidy. Of particular note, California and Georgia allocated most of their picks to their most distressed neighborhoods.

The States That Could Be Most Hurt Most by China Tariffs

Iowa could be the biggest loser if trade wars with China come to fruition, Fitch Ratings is warning. The Hawkeye State is one of the U.S.’s largest exporters of soybeans, corn and pork to China -- a $6.8 billion business in 2016 alone. Washington state is also exposed to potential higher tariffs from China because it ships more than half of its aircraft parts globally. In 2016, the $46.4 billion in these exports equaled nearly 10 percent of Washington's economic output.

This month, China published a list of 450 U.S. products (worth $50 billion in annual exports) that would be tariffed. The announcement was in response to President Trump’s threat to slap high taxes on China imports. Fitch notes the likelihood of the tariffs actually being enacted is uncertain, but adds that they could “lower business activity and sales and income taxes,” which could ultimately hurt state and regional tax revenue.

Kansas -- At It Again

One year after Kansas lawmakers repealed Gov. Sam Brownback’s 2012 tax cuts, some are now pushing for their own brand of tax relief. Legislation being considered by the House would -- among other things -- raise the standard deduction taxpayers take from their declared income on state tax returns. The measure, which is expected to cost the state $141 million next year, was passed earlier this month by the Senate.

The proposal comes as the state’s once-tumultuous budget has stabilized and officials are projecting a surplus of up to $610 million. Some are worried that a tax cut now would set the state back from that progress.

Even if the House approves the legislation, the Kansas Supreme Court will have the final say: It has to sign off on any plan that might affect its mandate on the legislature to increase education funding. That mandate will ramp up funding so that within five years, schools receive $500 million more each year than they do currently.",0,0,0,http://www.governing.com/week-in-finance/gov-finance-roundup-tax-reform-opportunity-zones.html
brookings,Will Opportunity Zones help distressed residents or be a tax cut for gentrification?,"States are fast approaching a deadline set by the new tax law to designate low-income neighborhoods as “Opportunity Zones”—a designation that will unlock favorable capital gains treatment for investments in those areas. Supporters say this will help revitalize distressed communities, but there is a risk that instead of helping residents of poor neighborhoods, the tax break will end up displacing them or simply provide benefits to developers investing in already-gentrifying areas.

Unfortunately, the evidence on the benefits of existing place-based policies is inconclusive. To understand whether Opportunity Zones are effective—and worth extending when key benefits come up for renewal as soon as next year—states have only a short window to act to incorporate evaluation mechanisms into their selection process. States and the District of Columbia must select qualified neighborhoods for Treasury’s approval by March 21. Only one in four low-income areas in any state can be designated as an Opportunity Zone, so states must reject more neighborhoods than they select. This is a perfect opportunity to build in a rigorous comparison of places that made the cut to those that did not, to see whether the program helps residents of low-income communities, which elements are effective, and whether it should be renewed.

For background, Opportunity Zones offer favorable capital gains treatment for taxpayers who invest in designated high poverty neighborhoods. Invest in real estate or businesses located in a qualified zone, hold it for ten years, and not only can you sell your investments free of capital gains tax, but you also you get a tax break on untaxed capital gains rolled into an Opportunity Zone investment. Individuals in a high-tax state and with short-term capital gains can avoid $7.50 in taxes for each $100 they invest, even before considering any return on their Zone investments. It’s very favorable treatment.

In high-poverty communities across the country, the persistent concentration of economic distress is a problem that dearly needs a solution. High poverty areas see a decline in the number of jobs and more businesses shuttering than opening. Children who grow up in them face long odds of climbing the economic ladder.

But our playbook of effective place-based policies is limited. In contrast to the new Opportunity Zones, the policy with the best proven record—Empowerment Zones—focused on people and local services not just capital investments. They encouraged hiring, subsidized upfront investment in capital and equipment, offered loan guarantees, regulatory waivers, a partial exclusion of capital gains, and large grants to local government authorities for local services and infrastructure. Researchers Matias Busso, Jesse Gregory, and Patrick Kline (2013) find that Empowerment Zones boosted local employment and wages. But the program was expensive and intensive, costing approximately $850 per resident. As a result, only 11 neighborhood zones were ever designated under the original design.

Beyond EZs, most other place-based policies haven’t been rigorously evaluated at all. For instance, while the New Markets Tax Credit program is widely lauded by investors and community organizations that help direct those investments, and has financed substantial numbers of projects, its design and implementation has thus far precluded a rigorous comparison of its net effect on investment or its benefit to local residents.

In high-poverty communities across the country, the persistent concentration of economic distress is a problem that dearly needs a solution.

There is no evidence that the design of Opportunity Zones will be as effective as EZs or other redevelopment efforts, particularly when it comes to benefits to local residents. Moreover, the theoretical effect of the Zone tax subsidies on local residents is ambiguous. It’s a subsidy based on capital appreciation, not on employment or local services, and includes no provisions intended to retain local residents or promote inclusive housing.

In an optimistic scenario, the tax benefits might encourage purchasing and rehabilitating residential property or expanding local businesses. But the value of the tax subsidy is ultimately dependent on rising property values, rising rents, and higher business profitability. That means a state’s Opportunity Zones could also serve as a subsidy for displacing local residents in favor of higher-income professionals and the businesses that cater to them—a subsidy for gentrification. Indeed, the highest returns to investors, and thus the largest tax subsidies will flow to those investing in the fastest gentrifying areas. Most major metropolitan areas are already grappling with the right balance between promoting development and helping existing residents. Opportunity Zones favor one side of that balance. With few guardrails that might promote so-called “smart gentrification”—policies to retain local residents and preserve or expand low- and middle-income housing—it is uncertain whether poor residents will benefit or be kicked out.

More immediately, the design of Opportunity Zones might encourage pressure on states to maximize tax benefits to their citizens—including their developers—to select gentrifying neighborhoods rather than the most distressed neighborhoods. Already-gentrifying areas are guaranteed to have large capital gains. Selecting those areas would maximize the tax savings to investors who would otherwise face large tax bills down the road. In contrast, the benefit for investing in moribund or deeply impoverished areas where rents and property values are stagnant is speculative.

One can see this clearly in recent Treasury guidance that provides a list of qualified low-income areas, relying on maps of Census data dating back to 2011. That means states can designate once-poor neighborhoods that have already gentrified over the last several years. In Washington D.C., for instance, qualifying areas include the planned developments around DC United’s new stadium at Buzzard Point, where investors plan to invest hundreds of millions in and around the stadium, and the NoMa neighborhood where office buildings and pricey apartments are sprouting. By designating those areas as Opportunity Zones, the D.C. government can wipe out the tax bill that would otherwise apply on the sale of those developments. The same is true for gentrifying hotspots like the Shaw, LeDroit Park, Truxton Circle, Mount Pleasant, and Brookland neighborhoods. According to one estimate, half of DC’s low-income neighborhoods have already gentrified—and not just in D.C. but also in cities like Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. Related Content Up Front Estimating the rising cost of a surprising tax shelter: the syndicated conservation easement

In Atlanta, Vine City, just adjacent to the new Falcon’s Stadium, is eligible to be designated as an Opportunity Zone. Much of the available real estate there has already been snapped up by developers waiting for Atlanta’s wave of gentrification to sweep through. In San Francisco, SoMa qualifies even though it already has a Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and REI, as well as the new headquarters of AirBnB, Uber, and Pinterest. Let’s hope, for taxpayers’ sake, that their IPOs will not qualify as Opportunity Zone Property.

That’s why it’s imperative that states establish a transparent framework for selecting and evaluating the efficacy of their zones before they submit their selections to the Treasury. The fact that states can only select 25 percent of their low-income communities as Opportunity Zones provides a prime opportunity for evaluation. California must pick 878 tracts out of 3,500. If more than 878 are nominated, California could select winners by lottery or, by ranking them by a transparent priority—for instance, by municipality and by child poverty rate—and selecting the top 25 percent within each city. That would help us learn whether the lottery winners or last picked performed better than those not selected. Absent a transparent and rigorous selection methodology, it will be impossible to tell whether the program actually worked to use the evidence to drive policymaking when this provision comes up for renewal.

In the absence of evidence, unevaluated programs often become permanent and costly additions to the size of government whether they work or not. Opportunity Zones have already hailed a “policy triumph” by one optimistic observer, despite not yet having gone into effect, little evidence that they will be effective, and a price tag that might soar by billions if permanently extended. Let’s make sure we know whether “Opportunity Zones” work when it comes time to renew them.",2018,02,26,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/02/26/will-opportunity-zones-help-distressed-residents-or-be-a-tax-cut-for-gentrification/
govtech,Map Monday: The Power of Geospatial Data in Opportunity Zones,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which went into effect this February, included a little-known new program called “Opportunity Zones” (OZs). According to the IRS, an OZ is “an economically-distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment” in order to incentivize economic development.

A Brief History of Tax Incentive-Based Economic Development Programs

At first glance, the concept has enormous promise, but it also feels oddly familiar. That’s because this program, or at least its core principles, are far from new. In fact, there have been several different iterations of place-based tax relief programs since the early 1980s. The idea was first presented in Congress in 1980 by Rep. Jack Kemp (R-NY) and was then picked up by both the Reagan and H.W. Bush administrations. Ultimately, President Reagan failed to garner support from Congress to pass legislation. President H.W. Bush was able to get legislation through Congress, but he vetoed the final bill because of provisions added to it that increased government spending.

The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act established nine “Empowerment Zones” and 95 “Enterprise Communities.” This was a five-year, $3.5 billion program made to “stimulate the economy, create jobs and revitalize economically distressed urban communities” through public-private partnerships, regulatory relief, tax incentives and block grants. The Enterprise Zone Approachwas supposed to “encourage private businesses to take root and grow” with the aim of “making such an area more attractive for private investment and job creation.” The Clinton administration eventually phased out block grants to primarily focus on tax relief efforts.

In 2014, President Obama announced the Promise Zone Initiative. As part of this program, 20 of the country’s most economically distressed communities were carefully selected to receive 10-year federal designations as Promise Zones. In addition to tax credits, these communities received technical assistance from federal staff and AmeriCorp members to ensure they were able to access all federal resources available to them and make the most effective use of federal funding. The ultimate goal was to “create jobs and increase economic security.”

The Trump administration’s Opportunity Zone Initiative is the latest attempt in a long history of tax relief programs aimed at incentivizing investment and creating jobs in economically distressed communities. It is also common practice among U.S. cities to provide tax relief to businesses as an incentive to set up shop locally; the most famous case currently underway is the fight over Amazon’s second headquarters.

Historically, these tax incentive programs have fallen short of their intended impact. While it is too soon to measure the impact of President Obama’s Promise Zone initiative, Enterprise Zones from the Clinton administration have been evaluated by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). One study from the GAO reviewed Enterprise Zones established in Maryland and tried to measure the effectiveness of the tax incentive program. Overall, the study found the employment rates were boosted in the three designated zones, but that the increase could not be tied to the program. They discovered that “market access … site characteristics … and financial incentives” had greater influence on business decisions than tax cuts.

Another GAO study reviewed how Enterprise Zone communities were spending federal dollars and dispersing tax benefits to ensure money was being spent properly and to link the program benefits to return on investment (ROI). They found that communities were indeed investing grant money in community development projects that supported education, housing, job training and loan programs.

Unfortunately, the study also found that the IRS had no data available that tracked tax benefits from the Enterprise Zone program. The GAO noted that this “lack of data limited both federal oversight and GAO's ability to assess the effect of the program” and that there had been “similar challenges in assessing the use of tax benefits in other federal programs.” It is important to note that the GAO was able to collect and use some data to report improvements in the poverty, unemployment and economic growth rates in some Enterprise Zone communities.

In looking at tax break incentive programs more broadly, researchers at the Brookings Institute noted that there is little academic evidence to support that tax incentives truly “influence business decisions to nearly the extent policymakers claim nor are they properly targeted to businesses and industries that can offer the greatest economic and social benefit.”

Setting Opportunity Zones Apart From Other Programs

According to Steven Rosenthal of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, what sets OZs apart from other similar programs is a delayed tax benefit plan that encourages longer-term investments. Tax benefits only go into effect “if the profits from the sale are reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) that, in turn, invests in businesses in a targeted community.” Also, if the fund is held for a decade, investors can “exclude tax from any gains that arise from investing in the fund.” Additionally, the criteria that determine an OZ are broader than other similar programs, with the U.S. Treasury certifying 8,700 OZs under the program guidelines. What stood out most to Rosenthal was the “remarkable lack of a governmental oversight role and for [the OZ program’s] generosity to investors.”

The following map, built by the Opportunity360 team at the nonprofit organization Enterprise with support from the Kresge Foundation, highlights all Qualified OZs in the US. Communities across the country interested in benefiting from the OZ program can use this tool to better understand their eligibility for OZ designation. Users can browse eligible tracts, filter by other federal place-based programs, and look at outcomes related to housing stability, education, mobility, economic security, and health.

Challenges Ahead

Despite differences in the details, tax incentive-based economic development programs share common challenges including:

Tax Relief Has Limited Impact on Business Decisions — As previously noted, GAO reports on Enterprise Zones found that “market access and site characteristics” have a greater influence on business decisions than tax cuts. Additionally, the Brookings Institute reported sparse academic evidence supporting the effectiveness of tax-incentive based economic development programs.

Lack of Governmental Oversight — The GAO report mentioned earlier also noted the challenges with a lack of data to enable federal oversight and evaluation of effectiveness of prior programs. Additionally, Rosenthal highlighted the “remarkable lack of a governmental oversight role” in the OZ program. Given this, monitoring where and how QOF dollars are spent or ensuring money is spent appropriately will be incredibly difficult.

Trouble Linking Tax Benefits to Economic and Social Outcomes — Academic research has repeatedly found little evidence to support that tax incentives “...are properly targeted to businesses and industries that can offer the greatest economic and social benefit.” While the intention of the Opportunity Zone program is to create a fund that will “invest in businesses in a targeted community,” the federal government is leaving QOF investment decisions in the hands of local governments with little to no guidance on how to effectively reinvest that money. This provides no guarantee that investments will be made in businesses that will grow and create jobs for local residents.

Overcoming Barriers to Success

While it will be a challenge for local governments to make effective QOF investment decisions, their close interaction with affected communities will help them address local priorities. A recent analysis by the Brookings Institute noted that the first 18 states to submit their OZ designations have done a great job picking “deeply impoverished places” to receive the tax benefits for investment. The average poverty rate of OZ designations in these states was 30%, the distress indicators of the selections (i.e., child poverty and educational attainment) were higher on average than the “low-income tracts they did not select, and selections had larger minority populations.” The choices states make at this stage of the program are incredibly important because it will ultimately determine whether distressed communities truly benefit from investment opportunities, or if investors will be the only true beneficiaries.

In light of these challenges, the map below was created by SMB Intelligence, a market intelligence firm focused on small business ecosystem dynamics based out of New York City, to help communities make these decisions. In an interview, Founder and CEO Steve Waters told me his company’s mission is to “drive inclusive economic growth through a stronger small business ecosystem.” Waters noted that the “Kauffman Foundation recently said that for every 1 percent increase in the rate of new businesses started in the state, there is 2 percent decline in the poverty rate. We believe that intentionally redirecting capital to help small business owners in distressed communities start and expand their businesses helps those communities grow and thrive.”

SMB Intelligence built this mapping tool to help local governments and QOFs direct capital to growth-minded small businesses. They do this by identifying “investable operating businesses,” as well as “prime growth activity” in OZs. “Prime Growth” is a growth-based classification standard created to identify the small businesses currently most likely to experience substantial growth and create new jobs. For a more complete breakdown of what constitutes an “investable operating business” or “prime growth activity” please go to their website.

“Investable operating businesses” are represented by blue dots on the map and “prime growth activity” by grey dots. The database that powers this map is updated every two weeks, with data sourced using an extensive open-source intelligence operation and self-reporting from individual firms, local agencies and nonprofits.

Run the cursor over any of the dots on the map and one can see both growth-based and socioeconomic indicators for the firm, as well as information about the owners and the census tract they are located in. It also provides insights into current job creation status, noting whether businesses are currently adding new jobs or will be in the near future. The database incorporates the Investment Score and Gentrification Flag created by the Urban Institute to determine if the area is likely to have gentrified already, and what level of investment has previously flowed into the zone.

Another challenge for local governments and QOFs in making investment decisions through this program is that the small business sector is incredibly large. Many firms will likely not qualify as “investable operating businesses” and many are not primed for growth. This tool is meant to help funds and agencies quickly identify firms that are likely to qualify and potentially provide a positive ROI in the future. It is also meant to assist local entrepreneurs to identify and pursue new businesses in OZs.

Just a few weeks after I interviewed Mr. Waters in early September, SMB Intelligence announced its pilot cohort for the Opportunity Zones tool in early October. Participants include Empire State Development, the California Governor's Office of Economic Development, the DC Mayor's Office, Access Ventures, the Fund for Our Economic Future, the Jain Family Institute, and Opportunity Alabama. They have also reached an agreement to support research by economists at the Federal Reserve Board and the White House Council of Economic Advisors. The map is also already being put to work by local government agencies, nonprofits, and small business investors.

The Power of Geospatial Data

Fittingly, implementation of this place-based program benefits from geospatial data to help stakeholders make informed investment decisions. Mapping has a key role to play in the ability of the OZ program to succeed and to improve economic conditions in distressed communities through strengthening small business ecosystems.",0,0,0,http://www.govtech.com/dc/Map-Monday-The-Power-of-Geospatial-Data-in-Opportunity-Zones.html
independent,"Female Isis members underestimated by security services because of jihadi bride stereotypes, UN warns","Jihadi bride stereotypes are causing female Isis members to be dangerously underestimated by security services, the United Nations has warned.

In the wake of home secretary Sajid Javid’s decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British nationality, an arm of the UN Security Council said there was an “urgent need” to monitor female jihadis remaining in Iraq and Syria.

A report said that countries choosing to leave women in conflict zones “could exacerbate future Isis-related threats and, more generally, threaten the long-term recovery and stability of the region”.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

The Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate said the situation was also “overburdening local judicial capacities and detention facilities, increasing the risk of human rights violations and sowing the seeds of potential further radicalisation”.

The report comes as the home secretary admitted the government did not know how many women travelled from the UK to join Isis, or how many British children have been born in the group’s territories.

Asked whether there was any plan for Ms Begum’s son, Mr Javid told MPs: “Sadly, there are probably many hundreds of children that have been born to foreign fighters.

“As I mentioned, 900 people have gone out, we don’t have a breakdown between men and women, but a significant proportion have been female foreign fighters.

“Some of them may have taken children with them, and many of them would have had children out there whilst in Syria and working with Daesh.”

Several British women became high-profile radicalisers, including Scottish university student Aqsa Mahmood, who communicated with the Bethnal Green girls on Twitter before they left for Syria.

Ms Begum is among at least 20 British women and children being held in Syrian Democratic Forces camps after fleeing Isis’s last territory, The Independent understands.

The UN report said only a tiny fraction of an estimated 4,700 female foreign Isis members had returned to their home countries compared to their male counterparts, with potential reasons including their inability to travel without a male guardian.

“Given the low number of female returnees, there is an urgent need to understand what happens to those who stay,” the report said.

“Even less is known about the fate of local women who lived in Isis-occupied territory and might have been associated with, or supported, the group in various ways, whether or not on a voluntary basis.”

The UN Security Council called on the UK and other member states to recognise the “many different roles, including as supporters, facilitators or perpetrators of terrorist acts” that women play.

Warning against assumptions that returning men pose a higher threat than women, the UN said not all male Isis members had combat experience and the group’s propaganda showed that some women did.

“The gendered assumption that women lack agency can have serious security implications by letting dangerous actors slip through the cracks,” the report said.

“Women play important roles in Isis’s recruitment and propaganda activities … even if women do not fight, they can still spread radical ideas and encourage others to commit attacks.”

Research suggested that women are treated more leniently by courts based on sexist assumptions about them being “duped” or forced into terrorism, meaning they are given less deradicalisation support and security monitoring.

In 2017 a judge spared a woman from prison who spread Isis propaganda online after her lawyer argued she was a “good mother” who was led astray.

“In your exceptional case, the sooner you are returned to your children the better for all concerned,” Farhana Begum Ahmed was told.

The UN report suggested such views may have been fuelled by the stereotype of naive jihadi brides who travelled to conflict zones for romance and adventure.

Researchers said the “tendency to ascribe rational motivations to men and emotional motivations to women” persisted, even though there was no evidence that the drivers of radicalisation differ by gender.

“Whereas women are infantilised and not taken seriously, and the risk that they pose is underestimated, men and boys are subjected to harsher judgements that ignore their vulnerabilities and dismiss the level of manipulation that they may have experienced,” the report said.

But the report added that violence against women and “disrespect” towards female Muslims helped drive them towards Isis, which offered a twisted version of empowerment to western female recruits.

gainesville,James F. Lawrence: Empowerment Zone would spur neighborhood turnaround,"Now that yet another highly regarded study has confirmed the existence of wide gaps between blacks and whites in almost every socioeconomic category in Alachua County, how will this community respond?

If the alarms that have been sounding since the study was unveiled by University of Florida researchers nearly two months ago are indicators, then here we go again: status quo.

True, more than a few non-profit agencies and community leaders have expressed concern. But what's needed is a community-wide response akin to what the nation is seeing in the aftermath of the tragic school shooting in Parkland.

More leaders like Santa Fe College's Jackson Sasser must step forward. A member of the Friendship 7, which paid $65,000 for the study, Sasser gets it. He understands that to effectively address wide disparities in Alachua County, “it will take the legislature, it will take the chamber, it will take all of us.”

The disparities cited in the study are in the same areas that Gainesville for All has been focusing on the past 18 months — jobs and families, housing and transportation, education, criminal justice and health. Among more than two dozen proposals made in our most recent report is the creation of what we're calling a Gainesville Empowerment Zone. The concept involves defining a neighborhood with at least one poor-performing school and infusing social services and educational resources that will help students and their families.

As school officials step up efforts to improve student performance, social service and non-profit agencies and volunteers will be added to help strengthen the neighborhood's families. That could include opening early learning centers, workshops for helping parents help their children with school work, and employment and mental health counseling. Fathers who for the most part aren't involved in their children's lives would be targeted with a special program.

If all of this sounds familiar, it should. This cradle-to-college approach to reducing generational poverty started in 2000 and was dubbed the Harlem Children's Zone. Because of the widespread attention the privately funded initiative received, the Obama administration in 2013 followed with its federally funded “Promise Zones'' in distressed urban neighborhoods across the country.

Granted, the HCZ has not been without its critics. Geoffrey Canada, HCZ founder, has refuted critical studies such as one conducted by Brookings Institute, saying they were too narrow in scope. Researchers agree that it's too early to assess Obama's Promise Zones, which partner schools with local businesses and community organizers.

But there is no denying statistics that show the HCZ had a 96 percent college acceptance rate in 2016, for example. By 2013 HCZ had a dropout rate of less than 10 percent, far below the national rate of 43.6 percent.

In the three weeks since GNV4ALL announced our latest recommendations, I've been heartened by the number of local leaders I've spoken with who are interested in exploring the Empowerment Zone concept in Gainesville.

For instance, Alachua County School Board member Eileen Roy liked the idea of choosing a neighborhood around Lake Forest Elementary School in east Gainesville. Just two years ago it was the district's only F-rated school and now is making significant academic improvements linked to additional educational services.

It's not hard to imagine a zone that would include a school like Lake Forest where myriad services would be poured into its surrounding low-income neighborhood. If successful, it's reasonable to expect more schools and neighborhoods would be added to the zone.

The Empowerment Zone concept, modified to fit Gainesville's unique needs, deserves a chance to finally start to turn around those disturbing statistics in the UF study that have been talked about long enough.

masslive,Springfield 'empowerment zone' school model considered for statewide expansion,"A unique educational model in Springfield may be replicated statewide -- if some lawmakers and the Massachusetts governor have their way.

The Springfield Empowerment Zone is a partnership between the state, Springfield school officials and the teachers' union in which eight public middle schools are overseen by a board and granted more autonomy to make decisions in areas like hiring, scheduling, budgeting and curriculum.

""I viewed this as a compelling model because this provides the ability to make changes while investing in the school system and maintaining local control of the school system,"" said state Sen. Eric Lesser, D-Longmeadow, who sponsored a bill, SD.1209, to expand empowerment zones statewide.

One important piece to getting the bill passed, however, will be ensuring that the model outlined in the bill is similar enough to the Springfield model to get consensus. ""The key is any legislation must specifically model the Springfield deal, because that was key to making it work, with an administration, teachers, unions. We all collaborated and worked together,"" said Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno.

For now, the bill faces opposition from the powerful Massachusetts Teachers Association, whose representatives says the bill would remove control of schools from local officials and put it more in the hands of the state.

""There's not a partnership element to this model,"" said MTA President Barbara Madeloni. ""There is an appointed board, so it undermines democratically elected school committees.""

Although the bill is one of thousands that have been filed, Gov. Charlie Baker gave it a boost when he mentioned it during his State of the Commonwealth address, indicating that the administration supports the move as a way to improve education statewide. ""These zones create more flexibility in schools and allow educators to make the changes necessary to provide a better learning environment for our kids,"" Baker said in his address.

The Springfield Empowerment Zone was started two years ago, when three middle schools faced the threat of a state takeover due to poor performance. Chris Gabrieli, CEO of the education consulting nonprofit Empower Schools, approached local officials about a new education model, similar to work that was done in Lawrence after a state takeover.

The result was a structure in which state and local officials share control of the schools through an appointed board that includes four state officials and three local officials. The educators in each school are given more flexibility than they would have under a normal district-run union contract to change things like the length of the school day or the curriculum.

""Most of what's happening in Massachusetts or the rest of country is either the district says this is what we're going do and the state approves, or the state takes complete control and does it its way,"" said Gabrieli, who is now chairman of the Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership. ""This is unique in the country in that it's a joint venture of the state and district, both of whom are responsible for these kids.""

Sarno said the structure combines the best of the public school system with the best of the charter school system.

""We all collaborated and worked together in really establishing best practices of what we do very well in our public system but then having the ability to have the flexibility of charter-type aspects of more autonomy,"" Sarno said.

Springfield School Committee member Denise Hurst said the empowerment zone works because ""it provides districts and families with an alternative, and it allows districts to have autonomy around instruction and learning time and how money gets allocated and spent."" For example, Springfield middle schools have created new electives and longer school days.

Gabrieli said the empowerment zone has made Springfield a national model. The only similar zone so far is in Denver, also established with help from Gabrieli's group.

The discussion over improving district schools comes after voters resoundingly rejected a ballot question that would have expanded access to charter schools.

The day after the election, Baker pointed to empowerment zones as a way to improve education and close the achievement gap between black or Hispanic students and white students without charter school expansion.

Gabrieli said the bill could be seen as a response to the message voters sent. ""The voters made clear last year that they they want to fix the systems we have,"" he said.

But some education policy experts say the proposal has been discussed by lawmakers behind the scenes for the last year, even before the ballot question's defeat, since even if there were increased charter school access more would still have to be done to improve district schools.

Schools are ranked from level one, the best schools, and level five, those schools that can be taken over by the state for poor performance. Lesser's bill would let districts with a level three school establish ""innovation partnership zones"" through a locally initiated effort. The state could establish these zones at level four and five schools as an alternative to existing turnaround procedures, such as a full state takeover. The schools would then have flexibility in setting curriculum, budget, schedule, staffing and other areas.

Several Springfield officials said the reason the Springfield model worked was because the union, city and state all cooperated, and the challenge will be ensuring similar collaboration happens in any new zones.

Madeloni said the bill as drafted is different from the Springfield model, because it does not require the same level of partnership. The board governing the zones would be appointed, unlike traditionally elected school committees, and would not be required to include educators or municipal employees. ""It's about taking public funds and putting it into the oversight of private hands,"" Madeloni said.

She said the bill ensures that the most powerful person overseeing the zone is the state education commissioner, since for the lower performing schools the commissioner has authority to initiate a zone. She worried that the model relies too much on testing to measure performance.

""We have a system of democratically elected school committees and collective bargaining in which people can come together and create schools that make sense to them,"" Madeloni said. ""This puts the power back in the commissioner's hands.""

On the other side of the issue is Liam Kerr, Massachusetts state director for Democrats for Education Reform, which supported charter school expansion and now supports expansion of empowerment zones. He noted that a 2010 education reform bill allowed for new ways to improve school districts. ""This is one of the ways that's working,"" Kerr said.

Kerr said the legislation seems to be about creating a model that brings people together while also having accountability. ""It's another tool for districts who have schools that are struggling academically,"" Kerr said.",2017,02,12,https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/springfield_empowerment_zone_s.html

cityam,Trump's former communications director Anthony Scaramucci returns to SkyBridge fund after stint in White House,"CMC Markets Contributor

After a brief and calamitous stint in the White House catapulted him to international fame, Anthony Scaramucci is back at SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund he founded in 2005

For a brief period in July 2017, Anthony Scaramucci found himself at the centre of American politics. Abrupt, frenetic and referring to himself as “The Mooch”, he quickly became one of the most memorable characters in the ongoing Donald Trump soap opera, despite spending just 11 days in the White House.

Before joining the US president’s administration, he put SkyBridge Capital – a hedge fund with billions under management that he had spent 12 years building – up for sale in order to “serve”. Having campaigned for Donald Trump, Scaramucci worked on the team managing the transition of power from the Obama administration. He then spent the first six months of Trump’s presidency on the periphery, blocked by insiders from moving into a position of influence.

That all changed, however, when he suddenly landed the role of communications director – reporting directly to the President – despite an almost complete absence of communications experience other than TV pundit appearances and a stint presenting Wall Street Week on Fox.

It was a strange appointment for other reasons, too. Scaramucci was known for having an outspoken, love-hate relationship with the media. And so it proved. Two days into his tenure, Scaramucci gave an interview to the BBC bemoaning “the back-stabbing that goes on” in Washington. “Where I grew up, we’re front stabbers,” he said, launching a tirade against “leakers”.

Shortly afterwards, another government leak was reported in The New Yorker by Ryan Lizza. Scaramucci had been acquainted with the journalist for a number of years and called him, demanding that he reveal the source of the leak. Scaramucci didn’t hold back, telling Lizza he wanted to “f**king kill all the leakers”. “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own c**k,” he went on, before calling Reince Priebus a “f***ing paranoid schizophrenic”. (As chief of strategy and chief of staff, respectively, both had vehemently opposed Scaramucci’s appointment.) While Scaramucci maintains that the call was off the record, Lizza says otherwise.

Scaramucci did in fact successfully oust Priebus. But in doing so, he put the final nail in the coffin of his nascent White House career: three days later John Kelly was appointed as Priebus’s replacement and ordered Scaramucci be fired.

Nonetheless, his time as director of communications made him a celebrity, with about 55 per cent of the US population recognising his name.

“These Washington jokesters went, ‘OK, that’s the end of him.’ But they don’t know me. And that’s not the end of me. These guys accidentally gave me a higher profile and a bigger voice in the conversation,” he says.

He seems to be enjoying the limelight: he frequently appears in the media, has released a new book about Donald Trump’s Presidency, and launched a podcast with his wife, Deidre Ball, a vocal Democrat supporter.

He is also back at SkyBridge Capital, which he pledged to “make fun again”, after returning to the helm. The time Scaramucci spent in Washington was, perhaps fortuitously, not long enough for the sale of SkyBridge to Chinese buyers to go through.

But while much has been written about Scaramucci’s stint in the White House and his colourful personality, there’s very little focus on his career as a hedge-fund owner.

Mooch the money manager

In stark contrast to starting his first day as the White House communications director with “a chainsaw and a hockey mask on” – a move that he now admits was probably the wrong one – Scaramucci has been cautious and calculated in his money-management career.

“As a money manager, the most important thing is compound interest and just staying in the game; recognising that the tortoise is going to win the race,” he says.

For the most part, this has served Scaramucci handsomely. While the hedge-fund industry suffered a brutal 2018, with four per cent losses on average, SkyBridge’s public fund made a 3.2 per cent gain. But his cautiousness also led to passing on a huge opportunity he now puts down as one of his biggest mistakes in finance: not buying Uber.

“I had an opportunity to buy into Uber at a $25m (£18.9m) valuation,” he says. “But when they came in with the business plan my reaction was that they were nuts. I thought: ‘I’m not going to put my wife or my daughter in a car with a stranger that nobody knows.’ My daughter now has the highest Uber bill in the world! I totally missed that opportunity.

“The money that I could have put in there would have been worth my entire personal fortune 10 times over. So I would say my mistakes are more in caution and missing unicorn opportunities.”

Nonetheless, the episode encapsulates Scaramucci’s view of money management: “I would rather make less money and delay gratification to ensure my clients are in a very steady ship.”

Spotting opportunities

Before launching SkyBridge in 2005, Scaramucci had already set up and sold his first fund, Oscar Capital Management, to Neuberger Berman, which was in turn purchased by Lehman Brothers in 2003.

In 2010, SkyBridge acquired Citigroup’s hedge-fund business. And on the back of the financial crisis Scaramucci made the decision to diversify, launching the SALT (SkyBridge Alternatives) conference in Las Vegas, an annual event which “facilitates discussions and debates on macro-economic trends, geo-political events and alternative investment opportunities”.

Presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton are former speakers at the event.

A fund of funds

SkyBridge’s main fund is a fund of funds, whereby investments are made into a collection of specialist funds and money managers, rather than directly into assets. Scaramucci isn’t a fan of the term, however.

“I don’t view us as fund of funds,” he says.

“The way I look at our business model, we are an outsourced multi-strat. Rather than having an internal mechanism with internal managers, I go with the best and the brightest in different sectors.

“That way I can decide where we’d like to be, and then allocate funds to the best managers in that industry. Then, if we don’t like those sectors anymore, we can take the money away without any of the internal politics.”

Most recently, leveraging Scaramucci’s knowledge of new tax codes that were developed while he was in the White House, SkyBridge launched a fund that invests in property in lower-income ""Qualified Opportunity Zones"". Created by a 2017 Tax Act, the scheme enables any fund that invests more than 90 per cent of its money into ailing areas to receive 10 years of tax-free returns.

""We launched in December and have already raised a tonne of money for it. I think we can raise $2-3bn in total. I’m super excited,” he says, adding that the ability to take advantage of opportunities such as this is one way hedge funds maintain their edge.

The Mooch on Brexit “When I think of London – and I lived there when I was a college student at the London School of Economics for a semester – I think of the city as a great destination for all of Europe and into the Middle East and possibly even North Africa, too. So when we were looking for a place to put the office in Europe, I dropped it in London.

“And we were actually opening that office a week or two before the Brexit vote. Somebody said to me, ‘Well, what if Brexit happens? Isn’t that going to change your decision? Wouldn’t you rather put it on the continent?’ I said, ‘No. The City of London has flourished for 500 years, with or without the economic union, with or without being in the EU.’”

“I don't know where you guys are going with Brexit; I don’t have any idea what you are doing. But for me, we’ve done very well in London. It’s been two and a half years and my guys in the City have attracted entrepreneurial capital from both Europe and the Middle East to our funds.”

Blue-collar kid

As a “blue-collar kid who grew up with nothing”, Scaramucci says the Opportunity Zone investment represents a way in which “Wall Street can help Main Street”.

He also says the minimum buy-in for SkyBridge's main fund-of-funds offering is just $25,000. Most funds start at at least $250,000.

“For some reason, regulators think that richer people are more sophisticated than poorer people,” he says.

“I tell my elitist friends, ‘You think you're that smart? The kids in my neighbourhood are as smart as you, their dads just weren’t doctors or Wall Street bankers who provided you with the opportunities you had.’”

Scaramucci says his charges are among the lowest: “We have lower fees than some of the multi-strategy hedge funds we compete with. Through our scale we negotiate down underlying manager fees on behalf of our clients.”

His background also forms the principles on which Scaramucci runs SkyBridge, and who works for him.

“In my business, the only thing that really matters for someone like me are your ethics. If I watched my father take his lunch out of the refrigerator and go to work at four o'clock in the morning and do everything right: paid his taxes, tried to raise his family, played everything straight; you're not coming into my shop at SkyBridge Capital and doing things wrong. We're not going to do anything in this organisation to hurt my father's last name, under any circumstances.”

Scaramucci grew up on Long Island, the son of a construction worker – and has an accent to prove it.

“I hustled my way into Tufts [University] and Harvard Law School,” he says.

Management and recruitment

As with all of Scaramucci’s endeavours outside politics, he often puts complete trust in others to run the business. At SkyBridge his core money management team has been with the fund for 14 years.

“You have to have the capacity to delegate. The employees of one of my competitors call him ‘The Bottleneck’, because every single decision inside the firm has to pass through him. It means he’s anchored to his desk and everyone else in the company is slowed down,"" he says.

“You have to allow your employees to make autonomous decisions. They have to take ownership. As part of this you’ve got to put your people in a position where they can fail or rise on their own ambition or own work ethic.”

Scaramucci adds: “I take a lot of pride in being able to recruit people, retain people and empower people. At the end of the day, I want the kinds of people who view this as a mission rather than just some job,” he says, arguing that the culture of teamwork and empowerment is one that stands in stark contrast to his experiences in Washington.

“Politics is not a team sport,” he says.

“It’s more like tennis, where you're going to have to beat each other’s brains in at a tournament. There’s a race to the top. I didn't expect people to act the way they did. These guys are on my own team. I didn't expect them to turn on me.

“The winning people in business are about collaboration and creating win-win situations, whereas in Washington it’s zero-sum. And let me stab your eye ball out while I’m at it.”

‘I didn’t understand the viciousness’

So why did Scaramucci enter the White House in the first place? “Stupidity,” is his simple answer. He likens his decision to the 1939 comedy film Mr Smith Goes To Washington, in which a new senator attempts to single-handedly change a corrupt political system.

“When a buddy of yours wins the presidency and asks you to go work for him, you think it’s part of the American dream. I thought, ‘I’m going to go there, try to do a good job, and try and help people who had similar upbringing to me.’

“But I didn’t understand Washington. I didn’t understand the viciousness – that was my naivety, I have to own that. Getting my ass kicked as hard as I did was very humbling.”

With the gift of hindsight, Scaramucci believes that staying involved in the White House after “forces in the administration blocked my getting a job at the start” was a mistake.

But it was one that taught him some valuable lessons.

“It made me understand you can’t let your ego infect your decision-making because, once it does, you end up doing regrettable things,” he says.

“I should have dropped it. But I got my ego involved, and I kept pushing to get a job.

“At the end of the day, you have to be resilient. And you have to forgive yourself. You can't sit there and think, ‘Oh shit, 18 months ago I got fired from the White House for a mistake I made, let me kick myself today.’ I’m not doing that. I’ve dusted myself off, no whining, no complaining, I’m moving on.”

theoutline,Calling low-income areas “opportunity zones” doesn’t help anyone,"In an attempt to finally help people recover from the recession, states across the country have embraced a federal program that allows them to designate under-resourced Census tracts as “opportunity zones.” The opportunity zones program was first envisioned by the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank whose mission is to “empower entrepreneurs and investors to forge a more dynamic economy throughout America,” and was included in last year’s Republican tax bill. The idea is that if the government incentivizes real estate development and business investments in certain low-income areas — the so-called “opportunity zones,” which are chosen by state governors — regular people will benefit.

A Brookings Institution report from earlier this month found that 59 percent of areas designated as opportunity zones were in “economically distressed” areas. In the best-case scenario, developers will use these incentives to build quality affordable housing for middle- and low-income people, particularly in rapidly-gentrifying cities like San Francisco and New York. However, it’s just as likely that opportunity zones are just another form of corporate welfare that won’t trickle down to the masses.

According to a report from Bloomberg, Georgia has designated parts of Atlanta as opportunity zones, including the site of the city’s potential Amazon headquarters. (Atlanta is one of 20 finalist cities in Amazon’s ongoing search for its second corporate HQ.) A large swath of downtown Detroit — much of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, founder of the predatory mortgage loan firm Quicken Loans and member of the EIG’s “Founders Circle” — has also been given opportunity zone status. This doesn’t mean that Amazon or Gilbert will automatically receive tax breaks; Amazon hasn’t even chosen where it’ll have its next headquarters. But developers have plenty to gain from getting tax breaks to invest in gentrifying areas.

“It could be used to take affordable housing and convert it into market-rate condos,” Brett Theodos, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute, told Bloomberg. “Amazon could engineer it into an investment vehicle for HQ2.”

There are some historical precedents for this. President Clinton had “empowerment zones.” In the ‘80s, Republican Jack Kemp introduced a similar program, called “enterprise zones.” And researchers at the Mercatus Center, a “market-oriented” think tank based at George Mason University, found that enterprise zones and similar policies often contributed to cronyism and corruption.

Opportunity zones aren’t a new idea — they’re just the latest iteration of Reagan-era policies that didn’t work the first time around.",0,0,0,https://theoutline.com/post/4261/opportunity-zones-republican-tax-break-developers-atlanta-detroit

A provision tucked into the Republican tax-reform package enacted last year allows for capital gains on things like stock or real estate sales to be diverted into so-called Opportunity Funds. The funds invest in low-income Census tracts — known as Opportunity Zones — that have been strangled of investment in recent years and decades.

The Snyder administration selected the Opportunity Zones, which were then ratified by the U.S. Department of Treasury.

The manifesto committee headed by Rashid Alvi discussed issues, including unemployment, landless labour, empowerment of women, issues of electricity and power, reviving of old scheme of pension and minimum wages for labourers. It was decided that similar meetings would take place in every Lok Sabha constituency to get the views of the public and grassroot workers.

Sources in the party said there was a suggestion to include the issue of “stray cattle” in the party manifesto at the national level as it is not just affecting villagers in Uttar Pradesh but also in other parts of the country.

Party state president Raj Babbar said the party was also planning to come out with constituency-wise manifesto. He said the idea of such meetings is to prepare the ground before election and ensure that workers do not feel left out so that once election is announced, there is better co-ordination between the worker and the candidate.

Maintaining that each committee would set a time frame for the tasks, Babbar said, “Every Lok Sabha constituency would have its manifesto based on people’s demands. The manifesto would be prepared after meeting the people and would be given to the candidate to make promises and work accordingly.”

Co-ordination committee, headed by Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu, decided to divide the state into five zones and appointe a person in charge for each zone. All the in charges have been asked to visit their respective zones immediately and submit their report by March 16.

“There would be more road shows and nukkad meetings by Jyotiraditya Scindia and Priyanka Gandhi. The idea is to prepare the cadre on the ground before the leaders begin their visits,” said a party leader who was part of the meeting.

peninsuladailynews,Emerald Coast Opportunity Zone about to be in business,"Clallam Economic Development Corp. Executive Director Julie Knott receives a telephone inquiry in her office at the Lincoln Center in Port Angeles. (Keith Thorpe/Peninsula Daily News)

PORT ANGELES — A development incentive effort for low-income areas is being piloted by a singular collaboration of North Olympic Peninsula tribes, city governments and economic development groups.

It’s about to open its doors to investors who want to make money and do good in one fell swoop as soon as the IRS issues regulations governing the nationwide program, organizers said this week.

Those with capital gains ripe for spending will get a tax break by putting money into what’s been dubbed the Emerald Coast Opportunity Zone (ECOZ).

The bipartisan federal Investing in Opportunity Act, which includes the incentive, was added to the tax code as part of President Donald Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

The Clallam County Economic Development Corp., which is helping spearhead the effort, will discuss the program at an EDC meeting at 10:30 a.m. Thursday.

The get-together will be in a second-floor meeting room at the Lincoln Center in Port Angeles.

The public is invited to participate and make suggestions for projects that will address economically distressed areas in Clallam and Jefferson counties where basics of a healthy economy such as housing and jobs are in short supply, Clallam EDC Interim Director Julie Knott said.

Opportunity zones were created in more than 8,500 census tracts nationwide, mostly on single tracts, compared to the 11 tracts that constitute a single zone on the North Olympic Peninsula, organizers said.

In Clallam County, tracts are on the West End, the city of Port Angeles, and most of Sequim, but not Carlsborg and Joyce.

In Jefferson County, they are in the city of Port Townsend and the towns of Port Hadlock and Quilcene, but not Port Ludlow.

The stakeholders behind the effort are the Hoh, Jamestown S’Klallam, Lower Elwha, Makah and Quileute tribes; the cities of Port Angeles, Forks and Sequim; the Port of Port Angeles, EDC-Team Jefferson, and the Clallam EDC.

“We can be identifying projects right now,” Knott said.

“Definitely, a priority is housing.”

Knott and other ECOZ organizers are waiting for the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue final regulations for the program.

“The waiting game now is the IRS regulations that could happen any day now,” Kyle Johnson, executive director of the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe’s Economic Development Authority, said Wednesday.

He said the tribe will soon have a beta version of a website for hosting all Emerald Coast Opportunity Zone projects — including its own.

“I can’t imagine 2019 ending without the tribe having not having started some sort of significant housing development on the Peninsula.

“The Opportunity Zone represents the best chance for doing that type of thing.”

The ECOZ employs a capital gains tax break combined with a push to develop underserved communities.

To qualify for the Opportunity Zone designation, a census tract needed to have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a median family income up to 80 percent of the area median.

The zones offer a pathway for investors to reinvest unrealized capital gains by dedicating them to an Opportunity Zone opportunity fund — not to be confused with the Clallam County Opportunity Fund, which consists of sales taxes spent for infrastructure projects and which is managed by the county commissioners.

The funds are invested, through the Opportunity Fund — which does not have a cap — into a qualified Opportunity Fund business property, partnership interest or stock.

Investors can temporarily defer capital gains taxes until 2026 by rolling their gains directly into the ECOZ’s Opportunity Fund, according to Economic Innovation Group, a Washington, D.C.-based public policy group (eig.org).

Capital gains taxes are reduced by 10 percent if the investment is held in the fund for five years and cut another 5 percent if held seven years.

Investors receive a 10 percent capital gains tax deferral after five years, a 5 percent deferral after seven years that ends Dec. 31, 2026, and pay no taxes on gains from the investment after 10 years.

Gov. Jay Inslee approved the ECOZ earlier this year as one of 139 such zones in Washington state.

They were first designated in 18 states April 9, according to an IRS fact sheet (tinyurl.com/PDN-IRSAnswers).

Craig Nolte, regional manager for community development for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has held six workshops on the opportunity zones in Alaska and Washington, including one in Port Angeles in August.

“This collaboration is unique because it has tribes working closely with cities,” Nolte said.

“I don’t know of another opportunity zone across the country where tribes are working with cities unless the city is working within the reservation.”

Some have criticized past development-oriented tax-incentive programs such as so-called enterprise and empowerment zones, as being ineffective (tinyurl.com/PDN-IncentiveCritic).

Forks City Attorney-Planner Rod Fleck said the empowerment-zones established in the 1990s, of which Forks was one, were ineffective because, unlike opportunity zones, they lacked the compelling incentive of opportunity zones.

“It was a tax incentive, but not a tax incentive with a difference,” he said.

Nolte said the program provides “a significant benefit” to individuals and companies who pair the tax break with other incentives, such as the low-income housing tax credits.

“I’m telling people in our workshops that there are enough investors out there right now to incentivize states and local jurisdictions to just go ahead and move forward assuming this is going to happen,” he said.

“If the Emerald Coast project waits and doesn’t do anything now, other areas will be ahead of them for investors.”

politico,The $100 billion question,"As the American economy has grown more unequal, with urban areas thriving and rural areas falling behind, free-market Republicans have generally stayed away from the debate about potential government solutions.

That is, until Tim Scott came along.

Scott, the first African-American senator from South Carolina since the end of Reconstruction, grew up in working-class poverty. And he’s championed essentially the only congressional effort to close this economic divide during Donald Trump’s presidency.

Scott’s Opportunity Zones would provide tax incentives for investment in parts of the country that have not seen big gains since the Great Recession ended. He helped get the provision tucked in the tax bill signed by Trump in December 2017, and along the way won the support of several Democrats.

“I am certainly an advocate of the free market, without any question,” Scott told me in an interview. “However, my worldview, really, is oftentimes seen through the eyes of a 7-year-old kid, growing up in a single-parent household, mired in poverty, feeling hopeless, at times frustrated, realizing that there was more potential in me than I could get out.”

Scott acknowledged in our interview that, contrary to conservative orthodoxy, he does believe that government can play a role in pushing against the economic tendency for investments to cluster in certain areas while leaving others behind. “We always struggle with an even spread of resources,” he said, noting that one way government can address this is to ensure better access to broadband internet outside of major metropolitan centers.

The idea for Opportunity Zones initially came from the Economic Initiative Group, a D.C. think tank set up by Sean Parker, the tech billionaire who co-founded Napster and served as the first president of Facebook. Parker eventually enlisted Scott in his effort to get the Opportunity Zones into legislation.

The program would allow investors who direct their money into distressed communities to defer capital gains taxes for up to 10 years. It is not yet operational; the Treasury Department in October released proposed rules to guide investors on how to take advantage of the tax incentives. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested that the program could attract $100 billion in investment in distressed areas.

Tax incentives haven’t always proved successful in addressing entrenched poverty or stopping the decline of local economies based on old-line industries. And some progressives worry that programs like Scott’s can turn into boondoggles that give tax breaks to wealthy investors without doing much for the places they’re supposed to help. In a paper earlier this year, Adam Looney, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said there isn’t good evidence that tax incentives actually boost low-income local residents; Empowerment Zones, a previous government effort to boost troubled areas, wound up costing $850 per resident and in the end was limited to just 11 neighborhoods.

Scott, for his part, said he thought the program could create enormous investment within just a couple of years. “There’s over a trillion dollars on the sidelines that could be deployed,” he told me. “I think a realistic estimation, in the first few years, would be about $100 billion.”

Scott spoke to POLITICO from his office in North Charleston, S.C. The following transcript has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Ben White: I wanted to start with a kind of existential question. When we think of using the tax code to effect economic change and stimulate investment, we tend to think of it as something that Democrats do more than Republicans. How do you approach this as a Republican, when the classic Republican thinking is, “Just let the market decide”?

Sen. Tim Scott: What I have tried to do is create a program that is not a government-centric program, but that does create an incentive for people to take a second look at parts of the country that have been missed by the economic recovery that we’ve experienced over the last few years. In the Opportunity Zones, the poverty rate is over 30 percent. I look at it from a common-sense perspective and I ask myself, “Is there a way for me to positively impact the lives of 50 million Americans by providing an incentive to unlock investments for those areas?” And from my perspective, this is a free-market approach to doing so.

White: Let’s just explain to people exactly what Opportunity Zones are.

Scott: The short answer is, Opportunity Zones are aimed at folks who are willing to make a long-term investment in one of the distressed communities around our country ... If you will make a long-term investment in one of these zones, then you can defer—you don’t eliminate, but you defer—your capital gains tax for up to 10 years, or through the year 2026. So it’s a phenomenal incentive for people to take a second look at areas that they would not necessarily pay attention to because they would feel like the return is too low, or the risk is too high.

White: OK. And then when we’re talking about these Opportunity Zones, I think you referenced a number, 50 million, as in the number of people that could be impacted by this. How does it break down between rural and urban? A lot of times, when we’re talking about economic opportunity and inequality, there’s a tension there.

Scott: Ben, that’s a great question. I’ve been on a national opportunity tour. I’ve gone to states like West Virginia, Iowa, New Hampshire, that have large rural populations, including South Carolina … It absolutely works in rural areas, from poverty to the opioid crisis, and in inner cities. It certainly allows for the creation of jobs and, frankly, for a walkable economy, for the ability to walk to work. Its application is universal. As long as there is need, I think the Opportunity Zone legislation provides an answer for those areas.

White: Let’s just take South Carolina as an example, since it’s your backyard. What type of business do you see taking advantage of this Opportunity Zone?

Scott: Sure. Let me give you just two real-world examples. First would be, in South Carolina, we are a transportation-centric state. So high-tech manufacturing is booming from the coast to the mountains in Greenville. And so you could see the development of a support company for the Boeing Corporation here in North Charleston, whether it’s providing paint for the planes, or rubber for the wheels, or any other aspect of the engineering for the planes, there’s a ton of opportunities out there that you could see. The second example would be, we are heading towards a service economy in South Carolina. So while we’re going to continue to celebrate our success as a manufacturing headquarters, we are, at some point in the future, going to become what we call the “Silicon Harbor” in Charleston, in the upstate. We’re going to have a focus on the jobs of the future. And so you could see a company started in the Medical University of South Carolina spill into an opportunity zone. And as that company grows, you would see how quickly investors might find it attractive … not only do you have the tax deferral from your initial tax burden, but as your company starts to grow in that zone, that growth is capital gains tax free during those first 10 years of your growth.

White: Have you put a dollar figure on how much investment you think that this tax program could generate?

Scott: There’s over $1 trillion on the sidelines in the United States that could be deployed. I think a realistic estimate in the first few years would be about $100 billion. Talking with Secretary Mnuchin and others, they see, on the sidelines, $5 billion to $10 billion initially, looking to be deployed in just a few states. The states that I’ve talked to, I would add on top of that number another $10 billion or $15 billion.

So in the next several months, $25 billion to $30 billion. And in the next couple of years, $100 billion or more.

Scott grew up in poverty, spending his high school years living in this apartment complex in North Charleston. He’s now working to bring more investment to disadvantaged communities through Opportunity Zones, a new program enacted as part of the 2017 Republican tax cut package. | Raymond McCrea Jones for POLITICO

White: Let’s pull back the lens a little bit to talk about the broader question of access to opportunity in the United States, and the fact that it is so unevenly distributed through our economy. How do you think we got to this point?

Scott: I’m a young fellow. Not as young as you are, Ben, but I’m a young fellow. And I will tell you that all my life I’ve seen the same thing play out, and that is that there’s always an uneven recovery. And frankly, there’s typically an uneven success trajectory. There have been communities that have been mired in poverty for generations. And the real question is, how do we break that cycle? One of the ways that you do that is by making sure that the private sector, the free markets, have the ability to operate fully. When that happens, you see the most even spread of our resources. As an example, 10 years ago, the African American unemployment was about 12 or 13 percent. Less than six months ago, it was under 6 percent. Today, it’s in the low 6 percent range. What happens is, as we grow the pie, we see more folks being able to engage in finding and chasing the American dream, which is the fastest way to actually even out the recovery. I think we’ve seen that number improve for every minority group.

So when you take those dots and you connect them back, what do you find? What you find is that educational success seems to be still a strong indicator of the evenness of this opportunity in America. And so, for me, there are two major pillars. One is the economic pillar. The second is the education pillar. And if our goal is to make sure that we spread opportunities and success throughout this nation in an even way, we have to focus first on the education system, particularly the education system in the poorest parts of this country. A poor education system or a failing school typically leads to higher unemployment. Higher unemployment typically leads to more government services. And frankly, obviously, it leads to lower net worth. The correlation, of course, is that education and opportunity are like wet and water. They are very difficult to separate.

White: I want to ask you, more broadly, about what role government can play here. Are there other policy levers that we could be pulling? What else can Washington be doing to kind of work with states to address this problem of access to opportunity?

Scott: We could spend a long time talking about education because I think it really is the forerunner to opportunity. Another issue, of course, is the connectivity issue. Broadband and online services are a prerequisite for success in most of America. I think what you’re going to see in the next 10 to 15 years, and you’re seeing it start now, is the fact that people can live where they want to and then decide the type of work they want to do. Our economy is absolutely moving in the direction of people deciding the quality of life they want, the location they want. And then later deciding on the job they want because of the ability to work from home. So the truth is that we’ll probably see more opportunities in rural America than we’ve ever seen before, as people have the chance to pick and choose their site and then their jobs. That is going to be a unique experience for many people in the workforce because, up until now, they really haven’t had that as a real option.

White: It’s somewhat ironic that I’m recording this with you and talking to you from my basement in Englewood, New Jersey, even though I work for POLITICO.

Scott: In Washington, D.C.

White: So I’m a distributed worker and I’m—

Scott: And I’m in Charleston.

White: —taking advantage of connectivity. Exactly. We are dispersed right now, you and I. Just one more thing on the broad macroeconomic level that I’m interested in: the federal deficit and the national debt, and the fact that we’ve seen the numbers go up pretty significantly. An increase in 17 percent to $779 billion in deficit for the last fiscal year. I’m sure you’re probably hopeful that the tax cuts will pay for themselves long term. But how much do you worry now about that growing deficit and the debt on economic growth and interest rates going forward?

Scott: I was at lunch today with some folks and the primary question on their minds was the national debt and how we wrestle with that. One of the things that was clear to most of us at the table is that the tax cuts, so far, have actually increased revenues to the federal government, not decreased it. So we’ve cut taxes, but we always have believed in the Laffer Curve or the inverse relationship. Unfortunately, at the exact same time, what we’re seeing is that spending has not leveled off, it’s not plateaued. It continues to increase. About 70—maybe it’s 67 percent—67 percent of the budget is on automatic increase because those are our mandatory spending programs. We are going to have to not look at cutting benefits for our current people. That’s one of the fictional stories that you can find out there. You can actually reduce our long-term exposure without touching current beneficiaries, or, frankly, people within a 10-year window of receiving their benefits from an entitlement perspective of Medicare and Social Security. But we do have to wrestle with the long-term consequences of mandatory spending that we haven’t wrestled with before. But in order for that to happen, we’re going to have to do that in a bipartisan fashion or it just will not happen.",2018,11,20,https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2018/11/20/tim-scott-opportunity-zones-000793
chicagobusiness,How a new tax workaround could give West and South sides a boost,"Real estate developers and big banks are so bullish about the program's prospects that many, including PNC Bank and Goldman Sachs, are looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for designated distressed areas nationwide even though the IRS hasn't laid out many details about how Opportunity Zones will be regulated.

Tax incentives like New Markets Tax Credits, Enterprise Zones and Empowerment Zones have yielded mixed results, but none has provided a platform for smaller investors, family offices and high-net-worth individuals to invest in blighted areas, Jacobs says. Capital gains, he says, could give developers and companies kicking the tires on low-income neighborhoods an unprecedented pool of capital to help finalize a deal.

""Nobody's going to invest just to invest on the South Side. They need good deals,"" he says. ""But this could be the difference for a company (thinking about) building a new factory in a corporate business park in Elk Grove Village—now instead maybe it makes sense for them to do it"" in an Opportunity Zone.

SOUTH SIDE SWATHS

Chicago's zones are areas with an unemployment rate of 20 percent or more, median family income of less than $38,000 and a poverty rate of at least 30 percent, according to the city. That includes large swaths of the South Side, in neighborhoods like Englewood and Auburn Gresham, and West Side communities like Austin, as well as the former Michael Reese Hospital site in Bronzeville.

It's harder to lure tenants to distressed neighborhoods, and rents in those areas typically are lower, making real estate ventures harder to pull off and more expensive to finance. But if investors can factor deferred capital gains into their financial equation instead of simply a property's cash flow, that can drastically lower the cost of capital, says David Doig, president of Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, a nonprofit community development organization that has tapped various tax incentives to redevelop portions of the Pullman neighborhood and to build a Whole Foods in Englewood.

""Instead of paying 15 or 20 percent return on equity, for folks we've talked to it has been closer to 4 or 5 percent"" after accounting for the tax deferrals and savings, Doig says. ""That's significant.""

Developers say projects in Opportunity Zones will only come to fruition if they are sound deals independent of the tax benefit. But the program's 10-year incentive should get investors' attention and encourage long-term commitments that are required to turn things around for a distressed area, says Scott Goodman, co-founder of developer Sterling Bay and now CEO of Farpoint Development.

""Changing the time horizon for an investor allows things to mature in a more orderly way and takes pressure off of developers such as ourselves to quickly develop and then flip or refinance a property,"" says Goodman, who plans to pursue projects in Opportunity Zones and is part of the team tapped by the city to redevelop the former Michael Reese property.

ENCOURAGED BUT WARY

Economic development advocates are encouraged by the possibilities of Opportunity Zones, but as with any preferential tax treatment, they're wary they will funnel investment into projects and areas that are already on the upswing or would thrive without the incentive. Chicago's zones are mostly in areas of extreme need, whereas many of the 8,700 zones nationwide are in neighborhoods that are already gentrifying and may be more attractive to developers and fund operators.

The same effect could occur within Chicago. One beneficiary of the program, for example, could be the vacant former Sears and Allstate headquarters buildings in Homan Square, on the city's West Side, which were sold to a local investor last month. Although the buildings are in an Opportunity Zone, they are buoyed by several surrounding properties that have recently been redeveloped and filled with tenants.

Developers have shown they don't automatically pounce on low-income communities just because there's a tax benefit, says UIC Urban Planning & Policy professor Rachel Weber, noting that some tax-increment financing districts in blighted areas of the city have gone unused.

Opportunity Zones don't address ""quality of infrastructure, education and workforce development programs,"" she says. ""(The program) just treats poverty like a real estate problem. I think everybody knows it's a little bit more complicated than that.""

Given that rejuvenating Chicago's poorest neighborhoods may be a heavier lift than in other parts of the country, the program's local success will hinge on for-profit fund operators that are not well-versed in distressed neighborhood investments working closely with nonprofit financial institutions that normally focus on such projects, says Peter Vilim, co-founder and vice chairman of Chicago-based real estate investment firm Waterton.

""If you look at the for-profit and nonprofit sectors as, respectively, head and heart, you need the heart in this to make it work,"" he says.",2018,09,14,https://www.chicagobusiness.com/commercial-real-estate/how-new-tax-workaround-could-give-west-and-south-sides-boost
reliefweb,USAID Mali: Agriculture and Economic Growth Program Overview - Mali,"In 2019, the Agriculture and Economic Growth (AEG) Team at USAID/Mali manages a portfolio of approximately $24 million annually to support the Government of Mali’s National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) and the U.S. Government’s Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS).

GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MALI:

The Mali GFSS country plan serves as an overarching framework for integrated food security, nutrition and resilience programming. The plan is informed by results and analyses from the first phase of Feed the Future (2011-2018) and continues to focus on broad-based agriculturally-led growth to improve poverty, nutrition and resilience for Malians. The goal of the Mali GFSS is to sustainably reduce hunger, poverty and malnutrition by achieving three principal objectives: (a) inclusive agricultural-led growth and increased employment; (b) strengthened resilience among people and communities; and (c) improved nutritional status, especially among women and children.

GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS:

The proposed geographic focus is divided into two sub-zones: the central/northern Mopti and lower Tombouctou Region and the southern Sikasso Region sub-zone. The Mopti sub-zone is dominated by a Sahelian climate, while most of the Sikasso sub-zone is in the Sudanian climate zone. The two sub-zones currently have very different security situations. In Mopti, the security situation remains fluid with access to different parts of the region frequently changing (on a monthly, weekly and daily basis) based on dangerous conditions from attacks by bandits and extremists. A majority of communes in the Mopti sub-zone are included in the Malian government’s list of 166 most vulnerable communes, while none in the Sikasso sub-zone are. Sikasso, though, has higher rates of stunting compared to national averages, making it vulnerable from a nutrition point of view.

CLIMATE RISKS AND THE ENVIRONMENT:

Because of the differences in climate, cropping systems, security, and vulnerability to shocks found in the two sub-zones, different types of USAID programming is deployed in each of them. For example, as maize is largely grown in the South, almost all work specific to that value chain would occur in the Sikasso sub-zone. Pastoralists are mostly located in the Center and North, so livestock-specific activities and farmer-pastoralist conflicts are concentrated there. With the lower rainfall, climate shocks are also much more likely in the Center, making climate resilience extremely important in Mopti and southern Tombouctou. Additionally—as the internationally-recognized inland Niger Delta and Sourou Plain protected wetlands are both located in the Mopti sub-zone—a natural resource management component to USAID programming is very active there.

NUTRITION:

Both sub-zones have rates of stunting above the national average and will be targeted equally with nutrition-sensitive and specific interventions. Nutrition, health, and WASH activities will continue to operate in both sub-zones, building on their successful Feed the Future programming, while broadening their scope to fully target all 1,000-day households.

RESILIENCE:

USAID/Mali has further created a resilience focus zone in the Mopti region to build resilience of vulnerable people to recurrent shocks and stresses which have been exacerbated by conflict and high levels of poverty. Mopti was selected due to its comparative advantage of having high levels of existing Feed the Future, Health, Education and humanitarian assistance programs with which GFSS Mali will coordinate and plan appropriate interventions.

TARGETED VALUE CHAINS:

Our previous Feed the Future program targeted the following value chains: millet/sorghum, rice and livestock. Under this GFSS Country Plan, horticulture will be added due to the high demand for these products and the potential for women’s empowerment through increased access to higher income and farming assets as well as select high-nutrient vegetables.

STRENGTHENED AND EXPANDED CONNECTION TO MARKET SYSTEMS:

USAID will help producer organizations and farmers increase their capacity to correctly harvest and handle their production and preferably market it when higher price conditions prevail. Programs will work with the private sector to promote the spread of technologies that reduce post-harvest losses and improve storage and processing of agricultural commodities so that they are pathogen-free, contaminant-free, and high-quality, and thus able to attract premium prices in different markets. Improved handling, processing, and marketing activities will create new off-farm jobs, particularly for qualified youth. Programs will support profit-making ventures at the community level or in market centers to supply quality inputs, appropriate farm implements, and processing machinery to clean and improve the quality of agricultural products for sale on the market.",0,0,0,https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/usaid-mali-agriculture-and-economic-growth-program-overview

accountingweb,What to Know About Tax Credits for Workers,"It’s going to cost your small business clients to hire this summer, but at least the wages are deductible on their annual returns. Even better, if they hire workers from one of several “target groups,” a portion of the wages may qualify for a special tax credit.

This credit, which has expired and been reincarnated several times, is currently known as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and is available through 2019. In addition to the regular credit, a business may be eligible for a special “summertime” credit for hiring certain disadvantaged youths.

How does the credit work? Generally, it is equal to the worker’s first-year wages up to $6,000 if he or she works at least 400 hours during the year, for a maximum credit of $2,400 per worker. For disabled veterans, the credit may be claimed for the first $24,000 of wages, for a maximum credit of $9,600 per worker.

There is no limit on the number of credits a business can claim. For example, suppose your client hires five eligible workers this year who each qualify for a $2,400 credit, As a result, the business may claim a total credit of $12,000 – a dollar-for-dollar reduction of its 2018 tax bill.

Currently, there are nine target groups eligible for the regular WOTC. The latest category to be added, effective January 1, 2016, covers long-term unemployment recipients who had been unemployed for a period of at least 27 weeks and have received state or federal unemployment benefits during part or all of that time.

The other categories include certain veterans and recipients of various kinds of public assistance, among others. The complete list is as follows:",2018,07,05,https://www.accountingweb.com/tax/business-tax/what-to-know-about-tax-credits-for-workers

1. Why should you be elected to Congress?

For the past 14 years, a career politician, GK Butterfield, has betrayed and misrepresented his district. Of the 92 bills associated with his name, only 11 passed over 14 years. Of those 11 approved bills, 9 were simply renaming public facilities. We need a US House Representative who works harder for all of its citizens, not just the ones that fit the representative’s racial profile or political beliefs. I am uniquely qualified to represent the voice of CD-1 citizens due to the following:

I have grown 8 healthcare and technology companies (3 sold, 1 IPO, latest has a $42M valuation) and know how to create jobs and have been endorsed by The Frederick Douglass Foundation for my vision of prosperity. Contrarily, while Butterfield was President of the NC Black Caucus and while the rest of the state flourished economically, Durham NC (CD-1’s largest city) sunk to a 38.6% black unemployment and 1 out of 2 black citizens are in poverty. He also voted against the Tax Act and against our farmers.

I am endorsed by the National Right to Life and will give a voice to the unborn. Contrarily, Butterfield boasts a 100% rating by the nation’s largest abortion clinic, Planned Parenthood, so 280,000 North Carolina lives were aborted during his 14 years.

I place American citizens first and have an A+ immigration rating (e.g., end chain migration, end the visa lottery, implement e-Verify, secure the borders) with NUMBERSUSA! Under Butterfield, Durham NC became a sanctuary city prioritizing the rights of illegal aliens over the rights of our citizens earning him an F- Immigration rating by NumbersUSA.

Finally, I am the 9th descendent of Patrick Henry so I am a constitutional originalist believing that all Americans have common God-given and constitutional rights. However, political and ideological encroachments from the far left can no longer be ignored. As such, I will be the voice of patriots who will fight against socialism, open borders, an emergence of a tyrannical deep state, fascist suppression of free speech and freedom of religion, single payer healthcare and large government.

2. What was the most important vote taken in your district in 2018 and why?

There have been no public votes yet in 2018, but the most important NC state passed legislation was the Farm Bill protecting our farmers from wrongful lawsuits. The most important federal legislation was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act providing tax relief to millions of Americans while funding “Economic Empowerment Zones” generated by its doctrine (10% penalty) to re-patriate overseas investment back into our communities. The most important amendment on the Nov 6th 2018 state ballot will be the VoterID requirement because we have witnessed voter fraud in Durham County.

3. What is the biggest issue facing your district, and how do you plan to address it?

1 out of 3 CD-1 citizens are in poverty so our biggest problem is replacing poverty with prosperity. I plan to implement the following:

1. Instate the work requirement for able-bodied welfare recipients aiming to increase Welfare compensation by 2-3 times!

2. Fund (via private/government alliances) incubator, entrepreneurial and training programs in our communities and community colleges.

3. Create Economic Empowerment Zones from the little known TAX Cuts & Jobs Act doctrine using Re-patriated money to revitalize our outsourced industries and communities.

4. Revitalize the Black Wallstreet Angel Fund (Durham) with startups.

5. Eliminate business-preventing regulations.

6. Ensure that American citizens no longer compete with ILLEGAL ALIENS for jobs, housing or shelter!

4. What businesses and industries would you try to attract to your district?

The Economic Empowerment Zones will re-invest into companies that moved out of our state due to overseas outsourcing. These companies include apparel, furniture, automotive manufacturing and farm equipment. However, the high-growth technology companies in AgriTech, technology and utilities will be the fastest growing companies that will find the NC business climate (e.g., hiring pool, wage, schools, home affordability) most attractive.

5. In the face of a government shutdown, is it more important to make sure the budget passes or that your legislative aims are achieved? How would you apply your answer to the most recent shutdown threat?

The main function of the Congress is to legislate; however, the annual budget has become leverage for political agendas. I prefer pure budget bills, but, the budget process has become riddled with “pork” driving up the spending to almost $1 trillion per year. Simultaneously, entitlement programs have grown so large that funding them has become a burden. This spending has to stop, cuts have to be made and programs need to be re-invented in order to reduce our burgeoning $20 trillion debt. Once the military (including veterans) is funded and base entitlement programs are funded, NO new programs should be introduced in budget bills until spending is under control. As such, the leverage isn’t a legislative aim as much as it is affordability and fiscal responsibility. Therefore, it would be worth a reasonable “delay” to approve a budget to ensure that every expenditure has an offsetting means of paying for it.",2018,10,19,https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/candidates/candidate-profile-roger-allison/1535945250
psmag,Costs and Benefits: Are Corporate Tax Breaks in 'Opportunity Zones' a Good Idea?,"A little-known tax incentive could provide important investment to areas that haven't yet recovered from the Great Recession, but the incentives don't come without risks.

On April 9th, the Department of the Treasury debuted the first details of a new and far-reaching community-based tax incentive. In 18 states, newly designated zones could see a wave of new investment under a little-known provision of the recent tax overhaul.

These opportunity zones are designed to lure investment to the nation's poorest urban, suburban, and rural communities with a powerful tax incentive. By the accounts of some experts, the program could deliver a vital injection to areas that haven't yet recovered from the Great Recession. Yet it could also fuel gentrification in those communities where too much opportunity, too fast, has led to rapid displacement.

Nightmare scenarios under the opportunity zones program would mean tax benefits flowing to the wrong places or paying for the wrong things: Amazon receiving sweeping federal tax benefits to build HQ2 in D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood, for example, or payday lenders expanding their already substantial profile in places such as Louisville, Kentucky.

Or opportunity zones could just be, as critics contend, more of the same: the latest in a long line of economic development incentives that have failed to deliver. It all depends on how it's implemented.

""Amazon HQ2 could figure out a way to make this [incentive] work [for the company's benefit], potentially,"" says Brett Theodos, a principal research associate for the Urban Institute. ""Which is why zone selection matters so much. If we get places that really need the investment, it's more likely those benefits are going to accrue to low- and moderate-income people.""

Congress created the bipartisan opportunity zones program as part of the tax bill passed last December. It's an effort to try to rip up the stagnant and uneven pattern of economic development across the country, conditions that are dark and worsening. Even as the Department of the Treasury confirms the remaining zone designations—for 32 more states, the territories, and the District of Columbia—leaders are hammering out the terms for ""opportunity funds,"" vehicles that will allow investors to defer their tax liability by investing equity into a number of different kinds of assets within a community. Final nominations for opportunity zones were due to Treasury on April 20th.

The test of this program may be two-fold: first, whether cities and states pick the right places to be opportunity zones; and second, whether their federal partners set the proper guidelines for transparency and accountability.

Opportunity zone designations as of April 23rd. The final opportunity zone designations will be revealed in May. (Map: PolicyMap)

Across the nation, a huge gob of census tracts were eligible to be designated opportunity zones—41,201 in all. (That's a bit more than half of all the census tracts in the country.) State and territorial governors (plus the mayor of D.C.) were limited to picking just one-quarter of their eligible tracts to be opportunity zones. Unlike with Empowerment Zones, a more top-down Clinton-era predecessor, opportunity zones leave a great deal of discretion to state and local leaders as to where to steer the incentive.

""We don't have a lack of capital in the U.S. We have a lack of connectivity,"" says Bruce Katz, who until recently served as a scholar for the Brookings Institution. ""We have a matching problem. This incentive might accelerate our ability to match up.""

Katz is not a disinterested observer. He recently teamed up with Jeremy Nowak—a fellow at Drexel University's Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation and Katz's co-author for The New Localism: How Cities Thrive in the Age of Populism—to launch a consultancy related to opportunity zones. This work is taking them across the country to talk with leaders and investors alike about the program. Consider them matchmakers.

In Louisville, for example, that might mean turning an under-used high school into a vocational training facility. That's one idea for an investment opportunity in Louisville's historically black, near-downtown neighborhood of Russell, where Katz says he talked about the possibility with a school superintendent. A program to boost on-boarding makes sense for Russell (and for Louisville, and for Kentucky as a whole, and really, for America). The idea is that new investments will work hand-in-hand with other factors—assets, existing programs, benefits, local conditions—to generate new jobs and also produce new skilled workers to fulfill those jobs.

Below is a map showing Louisville's opportunity zones, courtesy of a tool built by Enterprise Community Partners. The opportunity zones designated by the state appear in orange. Russell, just west of downtown Louisville and across the highway that segregates the city racially and economically, is among the designated zones.

Other areas that meet the main criteria for eligibility but haven't been designated are shown in blue. These are Low Income Community census tracts: areas with either a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a median family income less than or equal to 80 percent of the area median income. Some tracts are eligible because they are adjacent to Low Income Community census tracts, even though they don't have quite the same poverty profile; rendered in green, these contiguous tracts can make up only 5 percent of a state's nominated zones. (Another 200 select tracts around the nation with especially high migration rates or low population levels were also granted special eligibility.)

In a month, Treasury will release the final opportunity zones. These designations will last a decade, meaning that decisions by state and local leaders will determine the fate of the federal program. That's key in differentiating opportunity zones from the New Markets Tax Credit: Local governments get say. Only one-quarter of eligible tracts will be open to opportunity funds. Local stakeholders' decisions in choosing between qualifying tracts will be especially consequential.

""There's a lot of variation in how much capital the qualifying census tracts are accessing,"" says Theodos, who led a project at the Urban Institute to show where opportunity zones could do the most good (and where they might not). ""That means that some places need the incentive more than others, and that ranges of course across place as well. The governors have a lot to choose from, and their choice matters quite a bit.""

The program's authors say that opportunity zones can offset a tilted economy. At a time when inequality is practically a new national anthem, access to capital is especially skewed, geographically. Whole swaths of the nation have seen a decline in large banks lending to small businesses or opening new branches. Smaller and regional banks have struggled to keep up with the majors (or they've been absorbed by them). In some places, banking disparities are the result of racial discrimination, while other areas are just being left behind.

At the growth end of the spectrum, venture capital is highly concentrated in a handful of metro areas, and so is high-wage job growth. Sacramento, Philadelphia, Buffalo, and Hartford have lost high-wage jobs to Austin, Nashville, and Denver. Growth in places hit hardest by the Great Recession—in cities such as St. Louis, New Orleans, Rochester, Columbus, and beyond—is mostly confined to low-wage sectors.

""Given the trends we're seeing in the economy, this is the right time and a necessary time to be re-evaluating the policy toolkit that we use to address economic disparity at the community level and the regional level,"" says John Lettieri, co-founder and president of the Economic Innovation Group, the think tank that helped to write the legislation. ""The toolkit we use now does not equip us very well to deal with the trends that we're seeing, which don't look anything like the trends we saw in the 1990s or 2000s.""

Here's how the incentive works: Individual or corporate investors can defer their capital gains on investments in opportunity funds for a certain number of years (and in limited cases, permanently). The asset classes in opportunity funds are broad and flexible, with few set parameters: think affordable housing, real estate, infrastructure, and even transit. Cities, suburbs, rural enclaves, and regions can establish their own opportunity funds to identify needs ranging from hyperlocal (small businesses) to intra-state (transit).

The new tax incentive is not a strategy by itself, Lettieri says. The fact that states need to ""down select""—or narrow down a list of many eligible tracts to final nominated zones—was baked into the legislation. The program will only work as well as local and state leaders plan it to work. There's nothing preventing a state from parceling out its opportunity zone incentives to places that are already gentrifying, as appears to be the case in Cleveland.

""The opportunity zone incentive is not a silver bullet,"" says Steve Glickman, co-founder and chief executive officer of the Economic Innovation Group. Cities like Louisville have a few different kinds of urban markets to consider. There's the medical district on the east end of downtown, which works like an innovation district. There's the area of the city near the University of Louisville that has a strong engineering focus. The near-in but economically fenced-off west end is another typology—but it's an area that the market has historically ignored or discounted or failed to appreciate.

The promise of opportunity zones is that self-selecting communities can identify their assets and signal their potential to investors. An opportunity fund that drives investment into small businesses and real estate into neighborhoods like Russell in Louisville could be a model for opportunity zones in other cities that are similar to Russell (and vice versa). The same way that innovation districts and anchor institutions resemble one another (as markets) from one city to the next, so will the to-be-determined opportunities in distressed communities—from South Bend to Louisville to St. Louis and beyond.

""[The market]'s going to begin to understand that the country has these typologies, has these categories, of different kinds of geographies and assets which then lend themselves to certain kinds of investment,"" Katz says. ""It's not like, at the end of the day, we're dealing with hundreds of radically different kinds of propositions. I think this is going to be a market that routinizes.""

Kentucky's opportunity zones cluster in urban tracts in Louisville, Lexington, Bowling Green, and outside Cincinnati. But many more eligible tracts (and opportunity zones) fall in exurban and rural areas—places where the reach of banks is declining, job growth has fallen off, and home mortgages are more likely to be under water. Much more of the country looks like these places than like the white-hot markets of Boston, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.

Kentucky: home of horse racing, bourbon, and more than 800 census tracts eligible to be opportunity zones. (Map: Enterprise)

Whether the opportunity zones program can avoid the mistakes of ""empowerment zones"" and other place-based incentives depends on what places leaders pick. In Texas, for example, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg submitted 27 tracts for consideration to the state: a few downtown but most of them stretching further out into Bexar County. (Texas Governor Greg Abbott included 24 of them in the state's final 628 nominations.) Knowing whether Nirenberg called it right means weighing a host of thorny factors related to race, class, blight, potential employment centers, and more.

Socioeconomic Change Red Flags

For the Urban Institute, Theodos' team charted various kinds of capital flows for every eligible opportunity zone tract out there. The project assigned each tract an investment score, a value based on four factors: commercial lending, multifamily lending, single-family lending, and small-business lending. Tracts with a high ratio of investment in one or all these categories earned a high investment score. At such a small geographic level, a high score can sometimes reflect a skewed reality: a concentrated share of low-income housing, for example, or a prison construction project.

Theodos also generated a ""socioeconomic change flag"" as a measure of demographic change in every tract.

Put simply, it's an indicator for gentrification. Tracts that earned a flag have showcased enough socioeconomic growth already that they don't need economic stabilization. For these neighborhoods, opportunity zone designation could mean property tax shocks, luxury development, displacement, and all the other undesirable effects of geographic disparity that the program is trying to solve.

In Louisville, the census tract that matches up with Russell—where investment might take the form of a new vocational school—has an investment score of nine (out of 10). That means a high level of existing investment, mostly in small businesses (which may reflect the $29.5 million that the neighborhood received through another federal program, the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative). Only one of the eligible tracts for Jefferson County (i.e., Louisville) earned a socioeconomic change flag, the gentrification bat-signal in Theodos' analysis. Kentucky leaders skipped this tract, although they designated almost all of its neighbors as opportunity zones.

The highlighted census tract, centered in Louisville's Russell neighborhood, has a high level of poverty. It's the center of the city's cluster of opportunity zones. (Map: Healthy Louisville Metro)

In some urban areas, it may be hard to designate opportunity zones without running the risk of transforming the neighborhood. For example, nearly every census tract in Baltimore City qualifies as an eligible low-income tract, but large parts of Baltimore definitely do not lack for private investment. By the Urban Institute's measure, nearly 20 percent of Baltimore City tracts are already gentrifying. A tax incentive for investors to build up areas like Fells Point or Station North—the places where investors are happily building already— will do the opposite of what the program's framers intended.

""Those communities that have experienced a lot of social change, it may well be that low- and moderate-income residents are not able to remain and benefit from the incentive,"" Theodos says.

Treasury has not yet released Maryland's designations. Same with Washington, D.C., a unique city-state with no rural areas within its 68-square-mile boundaries. Almost half of the District's opportunity zone–eligible tracts got Urban's gentrifying marker. The new tax incentive could carefully guide investment toward the parts of the city where it is still badly needed, or it could pour gasoline on a market that's already white hot.

""I think it's all over the place. I saw a few instances in which states seemed really sophisticated and knew what they were doing,"" Nowak says. ""They're grappling particularly with what urban areas can grow, and really grappling with the rural issues, which are really hard. Then I saw other examples where states just said, 'Give us your tracts, we'll use those and see if we can get them all in.'""

A Federalist Approach

Even as the administration is still mapping out where the nation's opportunity zones will go, policymakers and stakeholders are puzzling out what opportunity funds will mean to investors. Lettieri and Glickman say that the breadth of possibility for Opportunity fund investments is critical to ensuring that it works as an incentive for struggling communities across urban, suburban, and rural settings. The same tax incentive might build workforce development in rural Appalachia or affordable housing in downtown Atlanta.

""If these projects are used broadly to accomplish social good, to build affordable housing, to create new businesses and help businesses expand, then this program will be able to create a new ecosystem of community development financial institutions and equity investors coming together to support businesses and developers to do work,"" Theodos says.

""Alternatively, if it's used by payday lenders to grow their payday footprint, that might have a different effect on the local community,"" he adds.

But the upside is substantial too. Nothing in the United States serves quite the same role as, say, Sweden's Kommunivest, a consortium that enables municipal governments to raise capital by issuing green bonds. Done right, opportunity zones could serve an unfulfilled intermediary role between capital and places where capital has evaporated.

The problem is larger than a missed marketplace opportunity. Economic anxiety in America is linked to sincere systemic problems, from lifetime earnings gaps to lower childhood achievement gaps to higher suicide rates. ""Worst of all, the longer the unemployment spell, the less likely the possibility of reemployment—and by extension the opportunity to escape these terrible costs—becomes,"" reads a white paper by Jared Bernstein and Kevin A. Hassett. The Economic Innovation Group released the bipartisan paper in 2015 as its mission statement for opportunity zones.

Depending on what local and state leaders do with it, the program may exacerbate some of the problems stemming from growth in high-octane areas. But there are worse problems, and those are the ones that opportunity zones were designed to target.

""I think cities, counties, and states are grown-ups,"" Katz says. ""Let's take [this program] at its word and see if we can—in a classic, American, federalist, distributed way—figure it out.""

odwyerpr,Millennial Leaders: Proving Yourself Without Losing Yourself,"

Alexis Anderson

Career paths are marked by milestones, not birthdays. Promotions, aside from complete career changes, are probably the most prominent pivot points along the way. And while tenure is a valuable hallmark of leadership, years on a resume don’t tell the entire story.

I’m proud to be regularly called a “young” leader, though it took some getting used to at first. As the vice president of a multimillion-dollar B-to-B and technology division at a national public relations agency, I’m consistently asked to provide strategic counsel and a strong point of view to top executives with at least a decade or more years on paper compared to my tenure. There’s a consistent voice in the back of my head that tells me I sometimes have only a few minutes to earn their trust and attention when a meeting or big pitch is about to begin. Rather than let this voice intimidate me, it’s become a source of confidence to speak up early, often and with conviction.

Considered a Millennial by one year, I lean into my age strategically—having straddled a non-digital upbringing with a nearly always-connected career. This perspective has also made it abundantly clear that the expectations of a young leader are exceptionally high, and the runway to demonstrate value is comparatively short. For aspiring and new leaders in any field, I believe there are four critical areas to focus your time, talents and energy to successfully establish yourself without compromising your voice.

Get comfortable with the uncomfortable. If tough conversations and controversial decisions don’t come naturally, Millennial leaders must force themselves out of their comfort zones. Confrontation doesn’t have to be negative. However, it’s imperative to stay on course. Young leaders can struggle with the notion of fairness and wanting everyone to like them. Fair can and should be a daily goal, but not the expectation. Challenging a team member, client or even other leaders in your organization puts people on notice that you’ll not be walked on or intimidated because of age. Tough conversations, approached with a level head and respect, demonstrate that you’re up to the task and can address and bounce back from adversity. Young leaders must stand their ground with even more conviction than their older counterparts. Fair? Not really—but it’s the first reality to embrace and put into practice.

Self-reflect often. Millennial leaders have a distinct advantage in that we often put ourselves under a microscope daily, and according to a survey by Virtuali and Work Place Trends, 50 percent of us approach leadership as the empowerment of others. Did I bring a unique perspective to yesterday’s planning session? What are new things I can be doing to improve team culture? How can I change a policy I don’t support? Is there an issue brewing that everyone else has overlooked? Leadership, done well, requires constant self-reflection. Young leaders have the energy and passion to inspire real change and are ready to fight even harder for their ideas. Among young leaders, mistakes become much more than a teaching moment. Mistakes are corrected and followed up with new checks and balances to prevent a repeat occurrence. Successful young leaders very quickly learn how to set any ego aside and always look inward first to determine what could have been handled better from their seat first.

Remember the “trenches” mentality. Another significant benefit of being a young leader is that not much time has passed since daily expectations were directly related to the hard work at hand. In PR, for example, that means I have a very real perspective of the media landscape and what it takes to land that big hit our clients demand. I can counsel up to course-correct strategy and mentor-down to help the team achieve program goals. Young leaders have put in the late nights and tackled mind-numbing administrative tasks—and not so long ago. Elevating into leadership, while still making the time to roll up sleeves and do the work when it benefits the team, is an invaluable skill that keeps young leaders relevant. And when there are no tasks above the title of a new leader, trust and team comradery soars as well.

Lead 24/7. New executives, particularly Millennials, have likely spent their entire career connected. I remember the pride of being given my first Blackberry just one year into agency life. While there are certain drawbacks to not always knowing how to unplug, the flip side is that young leaders can be even more conscious of their power to lead from all facets of their life. This might mean sharing creative concepts or interesting industry news with clients on off-hours, demonstrating that their business is always top of mind. Leading 24/7 can also mean being an executive who’s unapologetic about leaving work on time for gym class or family dinner—proving that self-care truly does have an important place in the organization. This is especially critical for talent retention, as the majority of female Millennials surveyed by Bustle are nervous to set work-life boundaries. Opportunities for leadership happen at every moment of every day and young leaders must be particularly comfortable with embracing—and fighting for—this blended approach to work and life.

Never has there been a more exciting time to be a young senior-level executive. Millennials make up more than 35 percent of the workforce and people are eager to be a part of how this generation shapes the future. But the young leaders’ climb is undoubtedly a bit steeper, and having a strong voice must be balanced with enough humility to ask for guidance when needed. Self-reflection, a willingness to fail and an unwavering commitment to operating well outside of comfort zones all combine to lay a powerful foundation for today’s youngest leaders.

A statement from the Chattanooga Police Department says 38-year-old Nicholas Galinger was struck Saturday night while on a call with his field training officer. He was outside the patrol vehicle when a passing SUV hit him. Police say they are searching for the driver of a 2017 or 2018 Honda CRV.

Police say Galinger was taken to a hospital, but died from his injuries.

Chattanooga Police Chief David Roddy says the community “lost not just an officer. We lost a son, a father, a friend, and a protector.”

Anyone with information on the driver or vehicle is urged to call police.

Craig Coley was released in 2017 after he was pardoned by then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who said DNA evidence and re-investigation proved his innocence.

The Los Angeles Times reports Simi Valley officials said Saturday that the agreement would mitigate long, costly and unnecessary legal proceedings.

The city will pay about $4.9 million and the rest is expected to be paid by insurance and other sources.

The state last year approved a separate, nearly $2 million payment for Coley. He is 71.

Coley’s lawyer says the money offers closure, though no amount can compensate for the life he missed while imprisoned.

nj,A new 'opportunity' for N.J.'s low-income zones | Opinion,"I've heard it said that in the business of life, timing is everything. When it comes to opportunity in New Jersey, and specifically the federal ""Opportunity Zone"" program, the timing seems to be pretty good.

We have a new governor in Trenton who is looking for ways to get us moving again. This matters, because over the next several weeks, governors around the country will be considering which census tracts to nominate as Opportunity Zones.

This program became a part of the recently approved tax cut bill, and grew out of the proposed ""Investing in Opportunity Act,"" introduced last year. Sponsors included our own U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., along with Sen.Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and in the House, U.S. Reps. Ron Kind (D-Wisc.) and Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio).

The legislation makes certain changes to the tax code, enabling the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities. It would target certain tax incentives to these zones, with the goal of spurring investment in these communities. In the zones designated by each state's governor, investors and taxpayers can reinvest capital gains under a structure that defers the applicable taxes. If these investments are held for at least five years, they become eligible for specific reductions or exemptions.

N.J. businesses will suffer if this tax break disappears | Editorial For more than three decades, New Jersey's Urban Enterprise Zone program has boosted businesses hoping to compete with their suburban counterparts by offering reduced sales taxes and subsidies for unemployment insurance, among other incentives.

There are to be a limited number of opportunity zones in each state, as no more than 25 percent of its low-and-moderate income communities can be designated. State nominations are due at the U.S. Treasury Department by late March. Several factors govern how these zones can be nominated.

Prospective zones should already be the focus of local and state programs geared to attracting investment and revitalization. Secondly, nominees should generally be areas that have suffered business closures or layoffs. Finally, a would-be zone should have had some past success managing similar programs such as promise zones, empowerment zones, etc.

I believe that Cumberland County and its qualifying census tracts in Bridgeton, Millville and Vineland, as well as Port Norris, stack up well. What is unique about us is our ability to pool resources and work together on behalf of a bigger picture. Consider the creative approach taken to qualify as a single Empowerment Zone back 1999. Since none of these communities alone could compete with large metropolitan cities, our leaders submitted a joint empowerment zone application that included all four jurisdictions.

After approval, the resulting framework was so successful that even when the federal pipeline ended and most other empowerment zones around the country closed up shop, the Cumberland Empowerment Zone Corp. transformed and continues to play a vital role in our revitalization efforts by facilitating investments that might not otherwise happen.

This track record suggests that, if possible, we consider taking a similar approach with regard to the new Opportunity Zones. For the most part, the census tracts that make up the empowerment zone in are still in need of investment, with most having gone sideways or backwards after the Great Recession starting around 2008.

While Gov. Phil Murphy is settling into his first term and we are getting acquainted with his approach to governance, my sense is that he values innovative solutions and won't hesitate to look outside the box in dealing with the state's many challenges.

It's the collaborative way we have been able to leverage the strengths of the Cumberland County Improvement Authority and the Cumberland Empowerment Zone, along with our unique regional and geographical assets, that lets us punch well above our weight in terms of maximizing the resources we receive.

In such a fragmented landscape, which seems to be the new normal these days, all we can ask for is an opportunity in the form of a designated zone. But, the ""ask"" should be with one voice -- because that's when we're the loudest.

rockymounttelegram,Durham Republican challenges Butterfield,"A Republican challenger believes he is the right man to unseat longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield in the U.S. House District 1 race.

Butterfield, 71, is seeking his seventh term representing the 1st District, which consists of 14 counties, including Edgecombe. He is being challenged by Durham businessman Roger Allison, 60, who has worked for more than 30 years developing startup and small rural businesses, including those in the technology and health care industries.

Allison said he was called on by some clergy in the Durham area to run for the District 1 seat because they are concerned about the continuing struggles in their community. He said Durham has a 38.6 percent black unemployment rate and one out of two people living in poverty.

“We need to fund through the private sector and government alliances incubator entrepreneurial and training programs in our communities and community colleges,” Allision said. “We also need to create economic empowerment zones from the little-known tax cuts and job acts doctrine using repatriated money to revitalize our outsourced industries and communities.”

Butterfield, a Wilson native, said voters should re-elect him because he understands the challenges people face in Eastern North Carolina. He said he still has the energy and the ability to advocate for their issues and concerns.

“I have years of experience as a judge and now as a legislator,” Butterfield said. “I know the dreams and aspirations of the people I represent and I know how to work the legislative process to debate the issues and get results.”

Butterfield said making sure public schools have the resources to train students for the 21st century is criticial as well as investing infrastructure in rural communities that will attract industries and companies and create jobs for people living in the district.

At the top of Butterfield’s list he’s pushing for is to make health care accessible to all of his constituents. Butterfield said he has been leading the fight to expand Medicaid in North Carolina and was on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Butterfield said a provision was created whereby the federal government would expand Medicaid programs to include single adults without any children.

“I’m going to continue to push for Medicaid in North Carolina,” Butterfield said. “If I’m re-elected, the first thing I’m going to look at is the Affordable Care Act and try to find a way to get insurance premiums down. We also need to be able to negotiate drug prices under Medicare and right now, we can’t do that. We’ve got to be able to allow every American to have access to health care and afford insurance premiums because they’re going up 16 percent a year. That’s unsustainable because wages aren’t increasing at that rate.”

While most of the United States is in a mode of prosperity, people in the 1st District feel they are being left behind, Allison said.

“For the past 14 years, (Butterfield) has betrayed and misrepresented his district,” Allison said. “Of the 92 bills associated with his name, only 11 passed over those14 years. Of those 11 approved bills, nine were simply renaming public facilities. You add his salary up and that’s $2½ million dollars that we paid him to get two pieces of legislation that’s not helping anybody. When your policies are to expand Medicaid and give hope to people that welfare can be continued ... all it has gotten us is an increase from 13 to 16 percent poverty.”

Butterfield said for the past eight years, Republicans have controlled the state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives and have operated in an extremly partisan manner.

“They don’t care about providing a safety net for poor people, they don’t care about investing in education and preparing the workforce for the 21st century,” he said. “They’re pre-occupied with giving tax cuts to the rich, super-rich and to corporations. The Democratic agenda is about providing for the middle class and low-income class so that they can get good quality jobs and earn a salary. ... Right now, our country has taken a very radical turn to the right and unless we’re aggressive and willing to defend our values, then the Trump era is going to take this country in a direction that will not be good.”

chicagotribune,A public-owned bank? That's just one issue up for debate in an unusually competitive Chicago treasurer's race,"Most years, the Chicago treasurer’s race isn’t even nominally competitive — there hasn’t been more than a single candidate vying for the job at the same time this century.

But this year, the campaign to succeed outgoing Treasurer Kurt Summers is unusually heated for a position that generally attracts little attention. Three candidates are competing in the Feb. 26 election, in a campaign that’s been based on issues that traditionally fall outside the treasurer’s office’s purview.

The treasurer serves as Chicago’s banker, responsible for maintaining the city’s escrow and operating fund accounts. The treasurer also manages the city’s investment portfolio and runs education programs and counseling.

But some of the candidates in this year’s race want to stake out a bolder territory for the job.

State Rep. Melissa Conyears-Ervin said she will be a financial watchdog and seek control of the Council Office of Financial Analysis that looks at the fiscal impact certain ordinances might have on the city’s bottom line. Accountant Peter Gariepy, who unsuccessfully ran for county treasurer last year, vows he’ll run the office in a responsible but less flashy way. And, Ald. Ameya Pawar, 47th, said he would use the office to launch a public bank and campaign against income inequality.

Pawar touts his advocacy in the City Council on social and economic justice issues, including votes raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing paid sick leave, and the creation of the office of labor standards.

Pawar said he wants to use the treasurer’s office to advance issues — such as addressing income inequality — in a way similar to how an activist investor would operate. Under Pawar, he said, the treasurer’s office also would “target investments in companies that invest in green infrastructure.”

Pawar name-checked freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who is a popular progressive and has been a chief architect of the Green New Deal proposal in Congress.

“Rep. Ocasio-Cortez talks about putting billions of dollars into green infrastructure and transforming our industrial economy, remaking it, so to speak,” he said. “One of the key components of that, from the federal level, when they fund infrastructure projects, is having a local match.”

At the heart of Pawar’s campaign is a plan to create a public bank that he said would refinance student loans and invest in affordable housing. He’d also launch an office of economic empowerment that would look at ways to “address income inequality,” Pawar said.

Many people point to the stock market, job numbers, and unemployment numbers to judge the economy, Pawar said. Those numbers don’t accurately record the problems people face in today’s economy, where middle-class families can work steadily but struggle due to pay gaps, he said.

“There needs to be a disruption in how we measure economic progress,” Pawar said.

Though popular with some progressives, Pawar’s platform has led to criticism that it’s unrealistic and risky. Gariepy, who is backed by City Council Progressive Caucus chair Scott Waguespack, said Pawar’s proposals “are extraordinarily reckless.”

A public bank, would put the city in a position where it may have to foreclose on people’s homes and deal with loan defaults, Gariepy said adding that can be an awkward spot for an elected official.

“Is that really the position you want to be in?” he said.

Gariepy said he’s focused on being the city’s banker, not “political vanity projects.”

“If you’re not minding the shop and you’re off doing everything else, then it’s going to fall apart,” Gariepy said. “If it falls apart, the damage is catastrophic.”

Gariepy also said any missteps by the treasurer “will negatively impact the city of Chicago’s ability to meet its obligation to its pensions.”

Asked what she thinks about creating a public bank, Conyears-Ervin said that “on day one,” she would meet with the CEOs of financial institutions and “demand a plan for access” for residents and to find out how they will be investing “in all communities in Chicago.”

“That’s my commitment,” she said.

Pawar said the public bank he wants would be “narrowly structured.

“There’s a lot of scare tactics out there about what a public bank is and could be, but a public bank doesn’t have to operate like a private bank,” Pawar said. “Profit doesn’t have to be the sole motivator.”

Among Gariepy’s proposals, he said he will push to have a retiree representative on the municipal employees pension fund. He also would work with the City Council to amend minority-owned business certification to include LGBTQ businesses and work to only secure Chicago’s funds in depositories with a federal rating of outstanding or satisfactory.

Gariepy also said he wants to use “Opportunity Zones” under federal tax law to attract private investors on the South and West sides.

Conyears-Ervin, whose husband is 28th Ward Ald. Jason Ervin, said her experience growing up on the West Side and being born in Englewood provides her a “unique perspective.”

“It’s important we have a treasurer that’s walked in our shoes. It’s important we have a treasurer that knows the challenges and struggles of our everyday citizens,” Conyears-Ervin said, noting she holds an MBA from Roosevelt University.

As treasurer, Conyears-Ervin said she wants to move financial analysis of key legislation to the treasurer’s office, which she said would allow her to be an “independent watchdog of taxpayer dollars,” a move that the City Council and mayor seem unlikely to support.

She also said she’ll work with financial institutions to help expand homebuyer assistance initiatives and provide financial literacy programs.

Her focus on dealing with Chicago’s investment portfolio will be on making “safe” choices, Conyears-Ervin said.

Drawing on her Chicago roots, Conyears-Ervin also is running a TV ad that shows her meeting people at doors. One woman asks, “Are you the only candidate raised in Chicago?”

“Born and raised, and now I’m the state rep here,” she says. The woman replies: “Oh, I like that.”

Pawar, whose parents immigrated here, said the ad is “disappointing” and uses “code words.”

Conyears-Ervin countered: “I am the only candidate born and raised in Chicago. How is that disappointing if it’s a fact? I’m just painting the picture to Chicagoans to let them know that I know what’s needed in our communities, in all communities of Chicago.”

While Pawar has secured endorsements from Service Employees International Union Local 1 and various officials including U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley and Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, Conyears-Ervin touts her endorsements from groups including the Chicago Federation of Labor and the Chicago Teachers Union.",2019,02,14,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-chicago-treasurers-race-20190214-story.html
thinkadvisor,New Tax Bill Offers Attractive Impact Investment Opportunity,"Part of the tax overhaul enacted in 2017 is a special provision called the Investing in Opportunity Act, which focuses on drawing private investments into distressed communities. By investing in Opportunity Zones, investors with unrealized gains will be able to defer, reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes. According to the Economic Innovation Group, there is at least $6 trillion in unrealized capital gains in the economy, creating a significant opportunity for investors to exit locked investment positions.

Types of Investments

More than 8,700 census tracts in the U.S. have been approved as Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs), low-income areas that lawmakers see benefiting from an inflow of private capital. Many individual investors have the capital, but not the ability to invest directly in these areas, but they can take advantage of an Opportunity Fund, a partnership or corporation that invests at least 90% of its assets in Opportunity Zone property. Capital gains tax on the initial investment is deferred until 2026 or the time at which the investor exits the QOF.

The program will also enable sophisticated investors to invest in property directly, in a manner similar to a 1031 exchange, with the additional incentives of a reduced deferred tax bill and a requirement that only capital gains be reinvested. Such QOZ property may consist of real assets or companies where a significant portion of property and revenue lies in, or derives from, a QOZ. Additionally, if the deferred gain is held in the fund for five years, the capital gains tax on this initial investment is reduced by 10%, a discount that increases to 15% after year 7. If the deferred gain is held in the fund for at least 10 years, any additional gain on this initial investment is tax-free, further incentivizing QOFs.

To ensure compliance, an asset test will be conducted twice a year to confirm that 90% of a fund’s assets are invested in Opportunity Zone property. This fact has led some to believe that funds must deploy new capital into Opportunity Zone property within 180 days, although further clarification is needed. Thus, the Investing in Opportunity Act creates the potential for investors to reap tax gains while positively impacting impoverished areas that stand to benefit from an influx of capital.

Impact and Outcome

In the past, programs such as the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) were successful in leveraging billions of private dollars to create more than a thousand projects ranging from schools to health care facilities. Despite this success, there is some concern that instead of helping residents of poor neighborhoods, the new tax break will end up displacing them or simply provide benefits to developers investing in already-gentrifying areas. States and the District of Columbia were required to select qualified neighborhoods and submit for Treasury’s approval by late March 2018. Since only one in four low-income areas in any state could be designated as an Opportunity Zone, one hopes that there was a rigorous comparison process among zones to help ensure that the objectives could be achieved for the zones’ residents and not simply for the investors.

While final guidance from the Treasury surrounding QOFs is pending, it appears that there will be no federal regulatory process to measure the impact of capital deployments in Opportunity Zones. Without such “guard rails,” investments may in fact yield adverse social and environmental results such as gentrification. Skepticism about whether QOZs will positively impact the lives of a substantial number of local residents is a recurrent theme surrounding federal programs, as similar assertions have been made about Empowerment Zones and the NMTC. Without strong federal monitoring of impact, potential investors wishing to abide by the spirit of the law in helping low-income communities will need to identify QOFs whose missions reflect such a commitment.

Investing for True Benefits

Rebecca Lester, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford Business School, has undertaken a research study to determine whether the Opportunity Zones will lift neighborhoods out of poverty. While the study is still underway, Lester’s perspective is that the extent to which the projects actually help low-income residents is, to some extent, a function of how local governments participate in directing the investments.

For advisors working with impact-investing clients who could realize tax benefits from QOZ investments, it is important to conduct adequate due diligence to ensure that the clients achieve their impact objectives. The goal in evaluating the merit and strategies of QOFs is, ultimately, to determine whether distressed communities actually experience meaningful change.

vox,Paul Ryan’s farewell address contained a blaze of nonsense about poverty,"The first half of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s farewell address to Congress is dedicated primarily to his effort to convince himself that a deficit-financed tax cut for the rich represents not just an idea he happens to favor, but a substantive legacy that constitutes a worthy career-long labor. Then it went off the rails.

In the back half of his speech, Ryan challenged Congress to address the needs of the poor as he claims he attempted during his time in public service. This claim is at odds with his many attempts to take away health care for America’s most vulnerable, his abandonment of tax incentives for the lowest earners, and his commitment to dubious anti-poverty programs.

“You all know that finding solutions to help people lift themselves out of poverty is a personal mission for me,” he said, echoing a line that he has shopped to a lot of journalists over the years but that there is no evidence of in his record. He then went on to say a bunch of stuff that isn’t true about the social safety net, the American poor, and his own record on either.

It’s a perfect capstone to Ryan’s career: Rich people get tax cuts; poor people get pious words and misleading rhetoric.

Paul Ryan is wrong about the war on poverty

Ryan’s entire thinking about the subject of poverty is shaped by his deep commitment to a fundamentally false premise: the notion that anti-poverty programs have failed.

“Four years ago, when our nation marked the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, we exposed some hard truths,” he said. “For all the billions spent, and all the bureaucracies and programs created, the needle had barely moved.”

The sense that anti-poverty programs don’t reduce poverty is, however, largely an artifact of statistical methods. The official poverty measurement was developed before these programs were created, and thus it by definition excludes things like SNAP and Medicaid from measurements of people’s well-being. The measurements show data as if a family with $18,000 a year in income and no health insurance was in the exact same shape as a family with $18,000 a year in income and Medicaid coverage.

If you instead look at the actual amount of goods and services that low-income households are able to consume, you see that poverty has declined dramatically as a result of the Great Society and subsequent expansions of the social safety net.

Ryan doesn’t need to take my word for it. Check out the Annual Report on US Consumption Poverty assembled by Bruce Meyer and James Sullivan for the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

In response, Ryan would say that while social safety net programs may help improve the lives of the worst-off people in concrete material ways, that doesn’t really help because the real goal should be policy that lets people earn more for themselves.

“It is not just about creating jobs,” he said in his farewell address. “It is about restoring the meaning of a job, the meaning of work.”

Unfortunately, in his career as an actual legislative leader, Ryan executed a massive bait-and-switch on the question of making work pay.

Paul Ryan betrayed the poor on the EITC

Back in 2014, Ryan somewhat surprised the political world by endorsing an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion that was very similar to one Barack Obama had proposed.

The EITC isn’t a perfect policy, but by subsidizing low-wage workers’ incomes it does square the political circle between liberals who want to expend public resources on helping the poor and conservatives who want to insist that poor people need to work for a living.

To get EITC money you need to work for it. An adequately generous EITC ensures that when you do work for your living, you end up earning a real living rather than poverty wages.

The problem, as Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained at the time, was a disagreement about budgetary offsets:

Obama’s plan costs $59.7 billion over ten years. That’s a pittance in the grand scheme of the federal budget, and what we really ought to do is just add $6 billion a year or so to the deficit and leave it at that. But both parties have accepted a norm in recent years where all budgetary proposals must be at least deficit-neutral, so both Obama and Ryan include measures to pay for the idea. And neither set of pay-fors is remotely acceptable to the other side. Obama would pay for the expansion by raising taxes on hedge fund managers and rich self-employed people, while Ryan would cut other safety net programs and “corporate welfare,” which is this case means specifically energy subsidies the Obama administration likes. Ryan has explicitly rejected Obama’s funding mechanism, and it’s hard to imagine Obama accepting Ryan’s.

After becoming speaker, however, Ryan completely neglected the question of offsets and pay-fors.

He shepherded a tax cut that added $1.5 trillion to the deficit through Congress, and as soon as it passed he began championing legislation that would add trillions more to the deficit. He also pushed for Donald Trump’s plan to add hundreds of billions in spending — both military and non-military — as part of a larger Republican about-face on the question of whether or not deficits matter.

Back in 2014, Ryan was eager to help the poor with an EITC expansion but worried about how to pay for it. But as soon as Ryan stopped worrying about how to pay for things, he also stopped worrying about EITC expansion — and it didn’t get done. Instead of helping poor people help themselves by subsidizing their wages through the tax code, he championed the idea of helping poor people help themselves by subsidizing rich people’s investment income through the tax code.

Paul Ryan touts dubious “opportunity zone” measures

The one concrete measure Ryan can point to of his tenure in office that’s designed to help the poor is to boast that “new opportunity zones, part of tax reform, will bring more investment to distressed communities.”

One thing to note here is that Ryan is the speaker of the House, and the House’s initial version of tax reform didn’t even include these opportunity zones. They were added due to enthusiasm from Senate Republicans, and Ryan’s team agreed to them. But this isn’t even an idea he believed in strongly enough to push for when he had the chance.

As a side note, Opportunity Zones were not in the House bill. There was some House support but it was added in the Senate. — Richard Rubin (@RichardRubinDC) December 18, 2018

What’s more, Ryan was almost certainly right to be leery of opportunity zones.

Basically, these zones work by offering a special tax break to people who make investments in low-income areas. That’s a huge boon to real estate developers, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner seems to be making money off the opportunity zone concept. The theory, then, is that by giving rich people financial incentives to locate investments in poor areas, some of the gains will filter down to actual poor people.

That may or may not be the case, but it’s extremely hard to see why you would think that will get you more bang for the buck in terms of poverty-reduction than directly giving the money to low-income people.

What’s more, it’s genuinely not clear that these programs work at all. Jim Pethokoukis — again, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute — did a brief literature review in 2015 on what were then called Enterprise Zones, and found them wanting.

He quoted research from the San Francisco Fed that concluded that this form of subsidy primarily helps investors and secondarily helps area homeowners, while doing little to alleviate poverty (emphasis added):

First, even though some research on federal Empowerment Zones finds some evidence of positive employment effects, other research fails to find evidence of reduced poverty, and points to some increases in the share of households falling below other low income thresholds. Second, there is consistent evidence of housing price increases, implying that benefits are received by unintended recipients. Other results not included in the table sometimes point to negative spillover effects on nearby areas, suggesting that enterprise zones largely rearrange the location of jobs rather than creating more of them. Our overall view of the evidence is that state enterprise zone programs have generally not been effective at creating jobs. The jury is still out on federal programs—Empowerment Zones in particular—and we need more research to understand what features of enterprise zones help spur job creation. Moreover, even if there is job creation, it is hard to make the case that enterprise zones have furthered distributional goals of reducing poverty in the zones, and it is likely that they have generated benefits for real estate owners, who are not the intended beneficiaries.

Having misstated the facts on the safety net, abandoned his own good idea for reducing poverty, and touted a bad idea that he didn’t even favor, Ryan then shifted the discussion to his real passion in life: cutting the safety net.

Paul Ryan wants to take away poor people’s health care

Having wrapped up his poverty discussion, Ryan pivoted to the need for long-term fiscal balance — balance that he says should be achieved by cutting spending rather than by raising taxes. And while he conceded that his Congress didn’t accomplish this goal, he says that House Republicans laid out a framework for how to achieve it:

In this Congress, we came within one vote of real health care entitlement reform. Federal health care spending remains the principal driver of entitlement spending. Our bill would have reformed two of our major health care programs to make them sustainable and meet the health care needs of our country. So we have come a long way, and we are closer than people realize. Ultimately, solving this problem will require a greater degree of political will than exists today. I regret that. But when the time comes to do this — and it will — the path ahead will be based on the framework we have laid out to solve this problem.

The two “reforms” that Ryan touts here are making Affordable Care Act subsidies less generous so fewer people get health insurance, and turning Medicaid into a series of inadequately funded block grants so that fewer people get health insurance.

In other words: If you are poor right now, then in Ryan’s utopia you will be made even poorer as the government takes your health insurance away. This is consistent with Ryan’s stated belief that programs to give poor people health insurance don’t help fight poverty. But it’s inconsistent with the reality that a poor family with health insurance is much better off than a poor family without health insurance.

In their story on Paul Ryan’s legacy, Robert Costa and Mike DeBonis reflect that not only has “the nation’s red ink … grown since Ryan became speaker,” it’s also the case that “issues dear to Ryan such as immigration and poverty will remain for future lawmakers to solve.”

It’s important, however, to correctly understand the hierarchy of Ryan’s priorities. Ideas to help the poor, like the EITC, need to take a back seat to deficit concerns. Tax cuts for the rich, however, are worth doing even when they increase the deficit. And when it comes time to cut the deficit, the best way to do it is to take away poor people’s health insurance.

Under the circumstances, America’s struggling families should feel lucky that Ryan never really got around to implementing his vision for their future.",2018,12,20,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/20/18149040/paul-ryan-farewell-address-poverty-transcript-congress

yaledailynews,Federal program will lower capital gains taxes,"Residents in seven New Haven neighborhoods may soon be paying lower capital gains taxes thanks to a federal tax program, though not everyone is enthusiastic about the change.

On Friday, Gov. Dannel Malloy announced that Connecticut will nominate 72 “opportunity zones” across 27 municipalities as part of a new federal tax-incentive program created by the new federal GOP tax legislation. Under this program, each state can nominate up to 25 percent of its low-income communities — defined as census tracts with a poverty rate of over 20 percent or a median income under 80 percent of the state-wide median family income — for federal approval. People who make commercial and residential investments in these zones will be given favorable treatment on the capital gains tax, in an effort to spur economic growth in the zones, with details awaiting further federal decisions.

“One of my administration’s top priorities has been the revitalization, reinvention and growth of our cities,” Malloy said in his Friday announcement. “These opportunity zone nominations we have made will go a long way in encouraging new investment and development in areas that will be critical to Connecticut’s future.”

According to Rob Michalik, government relations director for the state Department of Economic and Community Development, municipalities submitted a ranked list of eligible tracts to the state, which then selected one fourth of them for nominations. Selection criteria included the area’s development potential, economic need and other factors including prospective transit projects and the state’s existing investments, Michalik said. The federal government is expected to mostly honor states’ recommendations.

Once enacted, the program will allow people to place capital gains from previous investments in “opportunity funds,” which will flow to development projects in designated areas, Michalik said. By doing so, the people can pay a smaller portion of the original taxes at a later date. Michalik acknowledged the program’s fluid future but remained hopeful that it can be effective under sound management.

“It is an open question as to how this program is going to be,” Michalik said. “We will have to come forward as a state, in conjunction with communities, to present these opportunities to investors so they see the potential. Once the designations are made, this is likely to be our next step.”

Others are more skeptical of the program’s potential.

Matthew Nemerson SOM ’81, New Haven’s economic development administrator, told the News that the federal government has yet to lay out the specifics for this program, sowing doubt and confusion in localities. While the program holds has the potential to spur economic growth in low-income neighborhoods, Nemerson said, the vague rules currently in place may also make it a “capital black hole” for people to avoid paying capital gains taxes.

Nemerson said that whereas previous initiatives to revive low-income areas, such as enterprise zones or empowerment zones, also provides tax relief for investments, the opportunity zone program is the first to focus on capital gains taxes. Judging by similar programs in the past, a cottage legal industry is likely to emerge and focus on ways to circumvent taxation by “recycling” capital gains into development projects, Nemerson said.

The seven census tracts in New Haven that received recommendations include portions of the Hill, Long Wharf, Fair Haven, Wooster Square, Dixwell and Newhallville neighborhoods.

Many economists also have pessimistic outlooks on the program. Adam Looney, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned that the program may be less effective than some previous efforts, including empowerment zones, a program created by the administration under former President Bill Clinton LAW ’73. One major reason, Looney said, is that the capital gains tax applies to only about 5 percent of the U.S. population, precluding engagement by the vast majority of residents and small businesses. The capital gains-oriented nature of the program is likely to limit how much it stimulates real estate developments, and states’ emphasis on “development potential” often excludes more distressed communities.

“From the past we saw a lot of benefits went to projects that would have occurred anyway.” Looney said. “[For this program], we have seen in some of states where the places picked are in much better shape than those rejected.”

Lotta Moberg, macroeconomic analyst at William Blair, a financial services firm, said that while the program may divert investments from more promising areas into more distressed neighborhoods, which tend to have a lower development potential, it is nevertheless similar to other redistributive policies that trade net outcome for more equity. One major pitfall, she warned, is that governments often make mistaken judgements in evaluating the need and potentials of different areas in a free market, dampening the program’s efficacy.

Still, state and local officials are gearing up for implementation efforts in the coming months. Michalik noted that communities in Connecticut will face competition from similar zones of other states, raising the stakes for states’ recruitment campaigns. Nemerson said the city will focus on the federal government’s pending decisions on the program and how it plays out across the nation.

“We will be looking very carefully at how other states allocated their districts,” Nemerson said.

Ten census tracts in Hartford were nominated to become opportunity zones, as well as seven tracts in Bridgeport.

From Feb. 12 to Feb. 15, the Wildcat Leadership Institute hosted a “Women Like You” convention, featuring five days of events all under the theme of female empowerment in business/professional settings. All events led up to a symposium on Friday, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., at the Bell Memorial Union Auditorium. Over 600 people attended.

“I was so sick of people telling me what I was and what I was worth, ” Jamie Clyde, Associated Students Executive Director, said in her keynote speech Friday afternoon. “If I want to soar with the eagles I couldn’t let the turkeys get me down. I grew to like the fight.”

Female leaders are a huge part of Chico State’s campus. Gayle Hutchinson, the university’s first female president, shows just how much women leadership presence has been incorporated into modern-day campus administration. And it’s not just faculty and staff. According to the Digest of Education Statistics at Forbes, women have been outnumbering men in college enrollment since the 1970s. Feminine presence, in every form, is now commonly seen throughout higher education systems; it comes as no surprise to see large-production leadership conventions centered around these presences happening at Chico State.

The convention started on Tuesday and Wednesday morning with a nail polish exchange where students could trade in their old polish for a new, “professional” color, said to be good for interviews.

“Nail polish is harmful when you throw it away,” Karla Rosa of Associated Students said. “You need to throw it away in a special way so it doesn’t release the toxins.”

On Wednesday afternoon, a female business leader’s panel was held in BMU 220G, where people could learn about what it is like to lead in a business setting. The panelists included Kelli Bell Nooney of Bacio Chico, Pam Farly of Sheltering Oak Farms, Sarah Richardson of The Canine Connection and Elaine Kramer with Associated Students dining. Topics of discussion at this panel centered around how to balance work and personal life, people of influence and specific barriers women might have to overcome in their careers.

“If you are open-minded, you’re always going to get something out of the experience,” Farly said.

“I think the balance [between work and personal life] is easier when you love what you get to do for work,” Nooney said.

On Wednesday at noon, The Wildcat Leadership Institute put on a free concert in the BMU Auditorium with a live performance by a local singer and songwriter, Hannah Jane Kile. She performed a cover of, “A Natural Woman” and stayed for questions after the concert was over.

On the last day of the convention, the “Hear us Roar – Women Like You Leadership Symposium” was held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the BMU Auditorium. Over 600 people attended this event that featured six keynote speakers including President Hutchinson and Jamie Clyde.

Including the keynote speakers, there were also multiple small session breakout groups where people could come in and talk to women leaders on campus and around the community. One of the panel group presenters was Juanita Mottley, the Student Health Services Director. To Mottley, being part of the symposium was all about empowering students on how to overcome adversities and remember resilience.

“It’s never too late to follow a dream and we should continuously strive to be better than the best and never be complacent,” Mottley said. “I want to use my power to influence others in every way that I can; to push and motivate others outside of their comfort zones to be the best.”

Much of the credit for organizing the event goes to Kate Harris, the planning committee president for the Wildcat Leadership Institute. Dawning her sparkly pink sneakers at the symposium (along with many other staff members), Harris stated that she thought the event was, “awesome” and, “very successful.” She coordinated the event, picked all the speakers and was the main leadership presence during the symposium.

This week-long convention had a lasting impact on Chico State students as well as sparking inspiration to take newfound empowerment into the future workforce.

“It’s been an inspiring experience to see all of these people in professional positions,” Brooke Kojima said. She is a junior nursing student currently part of the Associated Students staff. “They all want us to succeed and feel empowered.”

Although this was the first female-centered symposium at Chico State, Wildcat women continue to inspire, empower and reach new heights. Only time will tell what comes next for these leaders.

forbes,Triple Play Tax Break: New Opportunity Zone Funds Cut Your Taxes Three Ways,"As part of the December 2017 Trump tax cut, an unlikely group of billionaires and politicians quietly inserted a generous and complicated new tax break designed to lure big dollars into struggling areas known as Opportunity Zones, or O-zones. About 8,700 O-zones nationwide, ranging from run-down inner cities to dusty rural hamlets, have already been designated. But investors who want to take advantage of the new O-zone tax scheme can't plow money into these areas directly. Instead, they must do so through qualified opportunity funds, or O-funds. These funds will have remarkable freedom to invest in just about anything---from real estate to tech start-ups---so long as it's located in an O-zone and isn't a business Congress considers a vice. (No casinos, liquor stores or massage parlors.)

Intrigued? To get started you sell highly appreciated assets and invest cash equal to your capital gain into an O-fund. The flow chart below illustrates just how this three-part tax break could work for someone selling assets this year, as well as the extraordinary amount this shelter can save wealthy folks in the top income tax bracket.",2018,07,18,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2018/07/18/triple-play-tax-break-new-opportunity-zone-funds-cut-your-taxes-three-ways/

February 13, 2018; Next City

The recently enacted $1.5 trillion tax bill included within it a provision, authored by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott (R-SC), designed to encourage investment in low-income communities.

The relevant bill section, titled the “Investing in Opportunity Act,” permits governors to designate low-income census tracts in their states as “Opportunity Zones.” To qualify as “low-income,” the census tract must have as a poverty rate of at least 20 percent and median family income no greater than 80 percent of the median for the overall region. Designations must be made no later than April 22nd and will last for ten years. States that fail to designate zones by the due date will be ineligible for the program.

These provisions, as described by Black Enterprise, permit “would-be investors to defer capital gains recognition and the associated tax if they invest the gains in new Opportunity Zones located in ‘low-income community’ census tracts.”

In other words, if you bought stock in a company and that stock gained value, you can sell the stock for a profit and defer capital gains tax if you invest the gains in an Opportunity Zone. This approach provides an incentive for investing in communities that have, historically, not received investment.

A region, once tagged as an Opportunity Zone, will retain that status for a decade. Of course, such a designation may open other doors for assistance, be it at the local, state, or federal level, depending on what legislators and regulators do.

There is also a restriction in the legislation that says that no more than 25 percent of eligible census tracts may be selected as Opportunity Zones, a provision that is likely meant to concentrate limited investment dollars for greater impact. As a result, each state must decide which low-income tracts it wishes to select as priority zones. In Missouri, for example, the state has issued a request-for-proposals. Proposals are due to the governor by March 21st, leaving the governor’s office a month to select from among the proposals submitted.

Investment in Opportunity Zones is expected to occur through federally chartered Opportunity Funds. Individuals and corporations that sell stock and purchase investments in these funds will have their capital gains taxes deferred until they exit the funds. These funds will be “certified by the US Treasury and…required to invest at least 90 percent of their investment dollars into businesses or properties located in designated Opportunity Zones.”

The Economic Innovation Group has estimated that there are $2.3 trillion in unrealized capital gains, meaning that individuals and corporations are holding onto securities that they would prefer to sell, in order to avoid paying capital gains tax. The idea behind the Opportunity Funds concept is that the funds could tap into this investment capital, since capital gains tax would be deferred until the money exits the fund—presumably this could create a pool of investment capital for the designated Opportunity Zone areas. The cost of this tax expenditure program is estimated to be $1.6 billion.

This approach echoes Clinton-era Empowerment Zones. Clinton’s approach had the federal government choosing the locations, rather than the states, and brought to bear an array of government programs, including tax credits for businesses which added jobs in the zone, rather than trusting the market impact of increased investment. The new program differs from the Empowerment Zone program in two key aspects: 1) It won’t be limited to a few cities and could benefit rural areas, as well as urban areas; 2) the tax benefits flow to investors (i.e., through deferred capital gains) rather than involving direct tax credits to businesses that locate in the designated communities.

The Empowerment Zone programs—in multiple variants and under both Republican and Democratic administrations (each administration called it something different)—were generally seen to have meager results. While it is hardly clear that the wealthy need another way to defer capital gains tax, the opportunity zone program, by creating a common pool of money that invests in businesses in the qualified area, does help prevent the situation of having a business move into a community, collect the tax benefit, and leave, which was a common problem of the Empowerment Zone program.

One major flaw in the bill, however, is the need to create Opportunity Funds and not use existing community development financial investment (CDFI) infrastructure that has been developed over the course of two decades and now constitutes a nationwide community investment system with over $120 billion in assets. According to Next City:

It is not yet clear whether any existing organizations will automatically qualify as Opportunity Funds. For example, the US Treasury has already certified more than a thousand community development financial institutions, although that certification only requires 60 percent of an institution’s investments be made into low- or moderate- income census tracts. The US Treasury also certifies community development entities, which provide access to the new markets tax credit program.

Similarly, “Some advocates see it as a lost opportunity that the Investing in Opportunity Act did not automatically designate minority-depository institutions, which already have a track record of serving many low-income communities, as eligible to receive investment from the program.” If only newly formed organizations will qualify to serve as managers of Opportunity Funds, there is a danger of the loss of local knowledge and experience that could slow the program down and weaken its effectiveness.—Martin Levine and Steve Dubb",2018,02,21,https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2018/02/21/opportunity-zones-provide-new-flawed-community-investment-vehicle/
courier-journal,Black history: How U of L's Pan-African Studies changed me and others,"CLOSE February is Black History Month, and we're kicking it off with eight inspiring quotes from eight equally inspiring figures. USA TODAY 10Best, Louisville Courier Journal

A recent study ranked the University of Louisville as one of the nation’s top universities for educating black students.

To my mind, U of L’s relative success in educating black students depends, in no small part, on the longstanding role of the Department of Pan-African Studies in “making black history” indispensable to a quality education for all of our students.

As an undergraduate in the late '90s, PAS, as it was affectionately known among students, was an integral part of my own academic journey.

Aside from my father’s Sunday school classes in black baptist and A.M.E. church basements, PAS was my first encounter in a classroom where black students were in the majority, a black (male) teacher was in a position of authority, and black people’s history and culture were taken seriously as subjects worthy of critical discussion and debate.

Yes, there was Mr. Atkins, my elementary school principal and Mr. Madu, my African immigrant high school computer teacher. But, outside of these exceptions, there was no black male presence in my entire K-12 education. Neither was there any meaningful engagement with the history, lives, cultures, experiences, struggles, and contributions of people of who looked like me. That would not come until my freshman year at U of L.

I came to U of L as an electrical engineering major, took several interesting philosophy classes, and eventually ended up graduating with a degree in business economics. But, as a black student, the PAS classroom was where I felt most consistently embraced, engaged, enlivened and empowered.

These classes were unlike anything I had ever experienced. They were challenging. They were thought-provoking. They were provocative. They were filled with incredibly intelligent students from a variety of backgrounds. All of us brought our respective experiences, perspectives, questions and ideas to bear on the subject matter in a way that created an absolutely electrifying learning environment.

In those classes, my classmates and I were pushed beyond our comfort zones. We were challenged to think about a complex range of issues concerning people of African descent that many of us had never been afforded the opportunity or space to consider. In a word, the experience was transformative.

Though neither of my parents had gone to college, my experience in PAS convinced me that I wanted to be a professor.

After U of L, I went on to earn a PhD in religion from an elite private university, where I was privileged to work with world-class faculty and amazing classmates from a beautiful array of racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds. But, make no mistake, my passion for learning and critical thinking was sparked at the University of Louisville, in Pan-African Studies, surrounded by brilliant students and passionate black professors.

Also: I contribute to black history by helping my students rise above labels

In the fall of 2013, the 40th anniversary of PAS, things came full circle. I had the incredible privilege of returning to my alma mater. No longer a student, but now a professor in the Departments of Pan-African Studies and Comparative Humanities.

More than 20 years since taking my first PAS class, it is sheer joy to see my students experiencing a similar sense of excitement and empowerment in my classes. But, it is more than disappointing (though not surprising) when all too many of my students tell me that I am now their first black teacher. In 2019, it is a tragedy that many of them come to PAS having been deprived of meaningful opportunities to learn much about black folks in K-12 or in other classes at U of L.

So, I work. Every. Single. Day. In two different departments. “Making black history” relevant to students’ lives in ways that will, hopefully, serve them well into the future.

And, I challenge them to work. Every. Single. Day.

“Dr. McCormack, why do we have to read so much in your class? And, why are your tests so hard?”

“Because if no one else has ever told you, I believe that you all are as brilliant as any student, anywhere, and you are more than capable of doing this work!

“And because our ancestors lived and died to provide us with this opportunity to learn, and we are going to take advantage of it!

“And because the old folks said, ‘you’ve got to work twice as hard to get half as far.’

“And because we’re counting on you to go twice as far to make this world a better place for all of us to live, including those generations coming after us.

“And because ‘to be young, gifted, and black … with your soul intact,’ as Aretha put it, you’re going to need a deeper understanding of what DuBois called ‘our spiritual strivings’ throughout centuries of attempted dehumanization.

“And where and when else will you have the opportunity to think about these things?”

Many of my students rise to meet my highest expectations. Of course, not all live up to their potential, and I have been disappointed in some for squandering their opportunities. But, so many of my students have proven that in the context of an affirming learning environment, when education is made relevant to their lived experiences, they will not only meet expectations, but exceed them in ways that we could not have previously imagined.

Read this: Rosa Parks has her own seat on Louisville's buses for Black History Month

I have had the privilege and joy of teaching, and learning from, a brilliant diversity of students: black, white, younger, older, wealthy, economically impoverished, gay, straight, trans, differently-abled, local, immigrant, urban, rural, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, atheist, you name it.

Indeed, PAS students, whether majors, minors or students who took as many electives from us as they could fit into their other major requirements, can be found all over the city, and indeed the nation, doing amazing work: from the Mayor’s Office to the Muhammad Ali Center, from the Urban League to law firms, from churches to community centers, from BLM to JCPS to LMPD, our students are making our communities a better place for all of us to live.

Unfortunately, there will always be those who question the significance and value of our work.

This is the history of Black Studies in the American academy. Academic rigor is constantly questioned. Resources are constantly limited. Too often, bricks must be made without straw. Fatigue and lowered morale often follow. The numbers of black faculty and staff steadily dwindle.

So, I am often the first, or only, black teacher my students encounter. But, I do not pretend to do this work alone. Indeed, none of us who are “making black history” could ever do so alone.

I am but one faculty member, working across two departments. Pan-African Studies is but one department in the broader university.

Nevertheless, I am privileged to work alongside dedicated colleagues in PAS, and across the university, who continue to find our motivation in our strong commitments to the worth and well-being of our students.

Something to do: Black History Month: 15+ ways to celebrate in Louisville

We remain convinced that what we do inside and outside of our classrooms matters. Our research matters. Our service in the community matters. Our students’ lives matter.

So, we stand upon the shoulders of those who fought, and continue to fight, to make the Department of Pan-African Studies a dynamic space that contributes to the “academic excellence and social responsibility” of the entire university.

And, we know, that in so doing, we are not only working to make U of L a top university for educating black students, but we are also working to make the University of Louisville a top school because all of our students are enlightened and empowered by their engagement with black history.

wltx,Columbia Mayor Benjamin delivers the 2019 State of the City Address,"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin has outlined his priorities for the city in his the 2019 State of the City address this evening.

Benjamin made his remarks Tuesday night inside the Karen Williams courtroom at the USC School of Law on Senate Street.

Here are his full remarks, as prepared for delivery:

Good evening, everyone.

A special welcome to my fellow members of City Council, Madam City Manager, all elected officials, neighborhood & business leaders and staff.

Mom & Dad, Dee, my wonderful in laws Donald & Adrienne Gist

Bethany and Jordan Grace – our daughters who are, with each passing day, becoming the young women God predestined them to be. We are so, so proud of you.

I’d like to also recognize Dr. Harris Pastides, a dear friend, who – in nearing the end of his ten-year tenure as President of the University of South Carolina – has become arguably the most admired and decorated leader in the history of the university. While it’s not my “well done” you’re looking for in this life, Harris but I hope you are proud of all you’ve accomplished. You will be missed, my friend.

And thank you for hosting us here at the University of South Carolina at this incredible new School of Law.

I remember many, many moons ago walking the halls of this School - not this first class building, though of course - never imagining in a million years I’d be back here – more than two decades later – delivering this address to the people of our great city. If you could ask 3L Steve Benjamin what plans he had for his life and career, he wouldn’t have come close to touching on the incredible plans God had in store for me.

So to my current law students here in attendance, remain encouraged and expectant. You’ll be amazed at where the road from Carolina leads you. Commit to upholding the standards and values of the practice of law – values of not only justice and fairness but also equity and the promise of basic human rights.

Look forward to the opportunity to play a role – whether small or large – in shaping the outcomes for people all across our great nation and the world, remembering that the vision for a more perfect union is ever in sight.

When in a position of power or authority, it’s imperative that we exercise our ability to influence and advocate on behalf of those who may not be able to do so for themselves.

Remember that Leadership is not about titles.

These temporary positions are fleeting.

A thoughtful leader recognizes that we are the manifestation of loving families, neighborhoods and communities that recognize that we lift people up—-we don’t beat them down.

And while this world grows more troubling by the hour, so it seems, I want you – and everyone else in this room – to remain hopeful. Hopeful for a tomorrow that does not always look like today; a tomorrow that brings less concern for future generations and more evidence of brighter days to come.

[pause]

My childhood was full of pain, and I say that very tongue in cheek as I was raised in an incredibly warm and affectionate household, early morning hugs and late night kisses from a Dad who worked very long hours and a Mom who worked full time cooked, cleaned and did everything possible to care for her home overrun by 3 men.



I mean that it was full of physical pain, rock fights and street football, standing directly behind the batter in stickball, chemical projects gone wrong, as acid burned through my favorite pair of Converse.

I was a curious and clumsy kid. Bethany and Jordan Grace love to hear stories of the boy they’ve nicknamed “Bad Stevie,” falling off of fences, garages and UPS trucks. Shopping cart races in New York City were unique experiences.



However-- One of my most vivid childhood memories is the stinging pain of being struck in the face with roller skates.

The year was 1981, and I’d just started at my new school Robert H. Goddard Junior High, named after the famed rocket scientist, or 202 as my wife still likes to laugh about the fact that NYC schools all have numbers.

Although I’d never been particularly good at it, I loved rollerskating.

Skating had enveloped American Pop Culture, and our teachers decided to take us on a field trip to Laces Roller Rink on Cross Bay Blvd in Queens.

Flashing lights, music blasting Y-M-C-A, disco balls---we had an awesome time.

So much fun that a group of us from our neighborhood decided to go back that very next weekend.



Things were very different on our 2nd visit.

The lights, the music and disco balls were there, but the environment had dramatically changed.

“Get out of here, niggers!!” - several skates flew - one struck me in the left side of my face.

What I didn’t fundamentally understand at the time is that WE---we children were a part of NYC’s experiment with school bussing.

I’d had experience with a few white teachers and administrators, but this was my first exposure to Italian, Irish, German, Jewish and Russian peers---

We were bussed from our home on Sutter Ave that boasted only one quiet older white family into a hotbed of racial strife later to be infamously known worldwide as Howard Beach. Where several of my classmates would go on to lynch and murder a man named Michael Griffith.

--

I still feel the pain of those skates striking my left cheek, but not because of the physical pain. But THAT BLOW wounded my soul.

It was my first experience with vivid racism, it stole my naiveté and innocence, and it made me a conscious race man for the first time in my young life

I live now in the American South, where painful images and family stories are shared regularly—I’ve been thankful for the support of these good men and women (point to council) to direct millions of dollars to telling the story of race in America, and I’ve committed myself to capturing those stories and telling how the pain and ignorance of racism, antisemitism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia steals innocence, destroys childhoods and communities and how we can never allow that to happen again!!



I remember my matriculation at the University of South Carolina.

'My first day on campus was my first day ever in Columbia, South Carolina. I’d worked all summer as a porter at the racetrack to buy brand new Air Jordans and sweat suits for the daytime and silk shirts for nighttime parties at the Russell House.

My first few weeks were difficult. All new acquaintances. No friends.

It was in the middle of the university’s ecumenical year---religious leaders from across the globe converged on the University of South Carolina.

Three weeks in, I was a 17 years old --- I remember standing on the historic horseshoe just a few blocks away waiting for one of the most powerful men in the world to address ME. And trying to understand my journey in how I got there...

I’d Stumbled from high school into USC.

I’d gotten into USC based on the prayers of my parents and teachers and good SAT scores.

Great parents, Well read, hot headed. I’d been suspended from high school twice and had to attend night school to finish high school on time.

And there I stand in this historic space, being addressed by the person that over a billion Christians across the world believe to be the Apostle Peter’s true successor—-

“Thou art Peter and upon this rock, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”

I watched Pope John Paul II’s popemobile turn into the horseshoe and make its way around past the Caroliniana Library, past the faculty house, the residence halls and Mckissick museum and finally settling in front of the President’s House.

Finally uttering in his Polish accent.

“It is good to be young

It is good to be young and a student

It is good to be young and a student at the University of South Carolina.”

I decided that day that I’d make a change in my life.

“Get your act together,” and I’ve never looked back.

I found a community that loved me and empowered me. I found a compassionate community at my Alma Mater.

And now I stand before you as the Mayor of the City that I love that has given me a family, a career, a platform to make change, and I know the reason that I thrived is that the environment that I grew up in was full of love and compassion in my home.

The reason that I thrived at the University of South Carolina is because of a loving environment, steeped in the soil of that campus that opened the doors to freed enslaved men and women in the 19th century and kicked it open again in 1963–the love and compassion there embraced me and pushed me to be my best self.

The reason that I stand before you now is NOT because I’m a self-made man. I am not.

I am God-made man. Everything that I am is because of the grace & unmerited mercy of God...and that Grace is manifested through the acts of each one of you and so many others.

We all are. It is our job. Our charge, our mandate is to build a Compassionate City that allows every child of God the opportunity to live up to his or her potential. Every child. There is no room, no space for bigotry, racism, antisemitism, islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia or any other offensive behavior.

In my faith, we are all made in the image of God and children of God.

My childhood experiences MUCH I guess like so many of yours has directed what I believe to be my life’s work. Bringing our communities together, pushing the goodness of human potential by building a compassionate city.

But, I say all that to say that we should also be proud of this community in which we live. Our city. And tonight, we’ll talk about why.

You see, the essence of every State of the City address is for us to discuss where we’ve been, where we are and where we’re going. We’re going to do that this evening, but I hope that this address doesn’t merely brings you up-to-speed on all things Columbia but instead excites you and re-instills a sense of pride and zeal for this Columbia and a sense of action to make Your city better.

Because to be frank with you - a good deal of our collective efforts are for naught if the community doesn’t know about them, engage with them and talk about them with their friends and family members here and in other cities.

We are not THAT Greenville.

We are not the Holy City.

We aren’t Charlotte’s got a lot.

We are Columbia. We are Columbia strong. We are The Real Southern Hot Spot. And yes to the chagrin of my professional brand marketers—-we’re still famously hot!!

And this past year, we saw why Columbia was named the #2 City Where Millennials Are Moving by Smart Asset. We saw why Columbia was noted as a Top 10 destination for people moving between 2012-2016 – a popular destination for white, black, Hispanic and Asian individuals.

Our city makes a step toward becoming the world-class city we aspire it to be every, single day.

We were the first city in the nation to issue a green bond for standalone stormwater upgrades, certified by the Climate Bond Initiative. Our first-ever green bond of $37.9 million bond is a major step in our bold effort to stop flooding in the top 20 flooding areas across the city -- we are not only funding stormwater improvements but also making an investment in sustainability. And if you’re wondering how that affects the City’s credit, the inaugural Stormwater Revenue Bond transaction received high grade ratings of Aa2 by Moody’s and AA+ by S&P.

In other exciting news, Columbia was named...

All of these items that we’ve been able to add to our already long brag list exhibit things our residents see about their own city, and they also show that people across the country hear about Columbia, too. And while it’s these mentions in the media we like to add to our metaphorical trophy case, we still have even more to brag about because of the incredible things we are doing collectively here in Columbia, South Carolina.

I want to highlight the work of a few of our departments.

Our public safety has continued to be among the best police forces in the nation, leading the country in 21st century policing tactics.

In 2018...

CPD hired 67 new police officers and 15 new civilian support staff.

They made one of the biggest investments in police technology to date in acquiring “ShotSpotter” gunshot recognition technology, which will cover 6 square miles of each region where it’s deployed and will allow officers to respond immediately Mr. Duvall once a gun has been fired.

CPD completed 202 “Handle with Care” forms, which alert Richland One School officials when a child is exposed to police action in the home.

They completed 1,199 home visits with youthful and juvenile offenders, which allows officers to make daily contact with these young people to ensure their whereabouts and conditions are being held accountable.

CPD held 216 Front Porch Roll Calls, which allow officers to build relationships with members of the communities they protect literally right on folks’ front porches.

The department provided more than 5,000 hours of training to officers and non-sworn personnel as part of the One Mind Pledge, which trains officers to properly respond to people in mental crisis.

The Department hired a coordinator for its Project Safe Neighborhood program, which provides a space for individuals convicted of violent crimes to be introduced to a variety of service providers in our region. From financial management to help with substance abuse, the goal is to ensure the attendees recognize that there is help available to them in our city. Compassion.

CPD knows the statistics, and those statistics indicate that these men and women will reoffend or will become victims of a violent crime if no one intervenes, and we don’t want that to happen – not for them nor for the people of this community.

All of this under the leadership of Chief Skip Holbrook and Deputy Chief Melron Kelly who each had noteworthy years as well. Chief Holbrook earned the 2018 Strom Thurmond Award for Excellence in Law Enforcement, and Deputy Chief Kelly was named to the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery Board.

Our law enforcement stands out on its own, but having a force led by such talented and experienced leaders truly makes a difference.

This December will also mark the 5th anniversary of our Justice for All initiative, which outlined a strategy to strengthen the foundation of trust and accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement agencies. Over the past four years, Chief Holbrook and his team have been able to make measurable improvements in additional training, increased accountability, competitive pay, community engagement and increased diversity in the force.

Those efforts are amplified by the work done by so many in our community who also care deeply about the wellbeing of our neighborhoods across the city.

We’re grateful for amazing partners like Serve and Connect and their founder Kassy Alia who, despite incredible tragedy, use what was meant for evil for the good and betterment of the community. It’s these intentional decisions to wield compassion like a weapon that allow us to change the landscape of our community, not only for crime but for other areas as well.

The support rendered by partners throughout our city cannot be spoken more highly of. Reliable and resilient human infrastructure will always be among our cities most valuable and treasured assets.

Assets that, like our city budget - which has reduced our tax millage consistently, Mr. Rickenmann, over the past decade - allow us to perform the duties of a city that are most necessary and desired of you. We continue to aggressively seek ways to address the systemic tax challenges that this region faces.

With skilled public administrators, led by Teresa Wilson and her team Jeff, Clint, Missy, the whole staff -- we’ve been able to do a great deal throughout our city by being innovative and knowing the right alternative funding avenues to take.

Ask our Grants Administrator Chris Segars how many dollars of grant funding the city received in 2018, and she’ll tell you it’s more than $3.8 million.

Ask our Director of the Office of Business Opportunities Melissa Lindler how much money has gone into Façade Improvement on Farrow Road and West Beltline Blvd. over the past year, and she’ll tell you it was a combined investment of more than $125,000 for five businesses.

Ask Councilman Sam Davis how much funding has gone to city parks in his district, and he’ll tell you… not enough!!! Though he gets it all.

Hyatt Park is funded and on the way.

Ask our Assistant City Manager Clint Shealy how much we’ve planned to invest in replacing every residential water meter in the system with a new digital meter, and he’ll tell you $40 million. These meters will provide real-time water usage data and will improve accuracy, efficiency and conservation, ensuring water customers have the most precise readings for their water usage. The new meter system will also be able to assist customers with budgeting and leak investigation.

As one of our state’s smartest cities - with 12 percent of residents holding a graduate or professional degree - we’ve begun matching our municipal intelligence with that of our residents.

In 2018, we introduced the MyColumbiaSC app, allowing residents to access City services via their smartphones. Perhaps the most significant and convenient feature, the app allows residents to report issues to the City’s Customer Care Department all with just a few taps on their phones. Residents can describe their concern, mark the location on a map and send a photograph of the problem without having to do any cumbersome paperwork.

As we invest in infrastructure in our city, we see major capital improvements continue at the Metro Wastewater Treatment Plant that will improve operational efficiency and allow for beneficial reuse of biosolids and associated biogas. Columbia Water is also evaluating the potential for a solar farm at the Wastewater Plant to provide an alternate energy source. Significant investments continue in the collection system, all geared toward rehabilitating and replacing infrastructure and providing increased capacity to support economic growth.

More importantly, these infrastructure improvements provide needed wastewater system capacity to enable high growth areas of the system’s service area to accommodate development into the future. The continued economic impact of enabling commercial and residential growth dwarfs the implementation impacts at 900 jobs per year. This proves that these are wise investments in both our infrastructure and our economic vitality.

Our sustainability efforts in the city continue as Columbia is one of more than 100 cities pledged to be 100 percent clean energy by 2036. This past year, Columbia completed a goal of giving away 1,000 rain barrels, with dozens more being purchased by folks wanting to play a role in stormwater averment as well. Our public works department also sold more than 300 compost bins, helping to divert organic material and green waste from the landfill to combine to make nutrient-rich soil.

The City of Columbia is working with USC in their partnership with the federal government, CSX, and others to develop an app this year that monitors railroad crossings and communicates with trains. This technology communicates with our first responders to predict when trains will prevent or delay police, medical and fire services from getting to their destinations. We can then reroute these emergency vehicles and work with railroad transportation to minimize (and hopefully eliminate) these issues and protect our citizens and property. We are excited to have university and railroads work with us to solve problems and what this does and can mean for the greater public good.

And, yes, we will continue our work aggressively on quiet zones this budget cycle.

We’re encouraging green modes of transportation in launching the bike share project in partnership with BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina - the blue bike. With 135 bikes across 15 stations, and potentially more to come, we all have the option of ditching our car on the drive to lunch.

That’s what each of these partnerships endeavor to do; make life better, more simply for the people of our great city.

And the good thing is that these programs don’t exist in vacuums. Programmatically, we’ve been able to accomplish so much over the past year.

In 2017, The Aspen Institute partnered with Pew Research Center and LendUp to host the Finance Forward city tour, gauging each city’s financial wellbeing based on residents’ responsiveness to income volatility. Since then, the City of Columbia has spearheaded efforts to ensure that its employees are experiencing good financial health. After an initial pilot in 2018, the City’s Office of Community Development has started the new Workforce Financial Wellness Program to offer budgeting, credit building and homeownership workshops during work hours for selected city departments. The workshops help employees deal with the burdens of financial stress, help employees practice good financial behaviors and understand the process of homeownership with an emphasis on covering banking, budgeting, savings, credit building and repair. In 2019, the program will be held for employees quarterly.

And not to be left out, we were incredibly excited to pilot the Child Savings Account program, Mrs. Devine, at Watkins-Nance Elementary, providing bank accounts with an initial deposit of $50 from the city to K-5 students. The statistics tell us that students who have even as little as a dollar saved are three times as likely to attend college and four times as likely to graduate as those without any college savings. How encouraging is it to be able to set these children up for success by doing something as simple as providing them with a bank account?

We must realize that access is everything; these students will have capital to achieve their goals, big or small.

And depending on where they attend school, some students have had additional access granted as a part of our Books 2 Boys and Girls programming.

Launched in 2016, Books 2 Boys and Girls was created in partnership with Richland Library and City of Columbia Parks and Recreation. Over the span of two years, we’ve hosted 12 book fairs, giving away nearly 8,000 books to more than 2,000 boys and girls in our community. This program isn’t just about giving kids in our neighborhoods books they can take home in fancy drawstring bags; it’s about our commitment to changing the ratio of age-appropriate culturally relevant books per child in our communities. When children can read well and have access to literature, they succeed in life.

With increasing importance and significance, it is public-private partnerships that make programs like these possible, and we are grateful to our first partner Cigna and current partner AT&T for making it possible for us to provide these books to our children. It truly takes a village to raise a child, and these days, it takes collaboration among public, private and philanthropic interests to make sure the next generation has the resources they deserve.

And in the spirit of building a village for our youth, we were so excited to spend quality time working with Mr. McDowell with 15 children living in Public Housing in the first-ever Mayor’s Summer Camp. Our staff took the kids to places that may be just five minutes up the road from their homes yet were still foreign to children who have historically been underserved and underexposed.

They made kale smoothies at City Roots. They climbed Eddie the biggest kid in the South at EdVenture. And they got to see K9 units in action at CPD headquarters.

In short, they got to be KIDS in Columbia - learning about a city that loves them. A city that’s putting policies and programming in place so that they’ll have opportunities in their futures that make room for their unique gifts and talents.

Each of our city departments and even boards and commissions are consistent with our strategic plan and are in some way working with this in mind.

Our Food Policy Committee ended 2018 with several hours worth of feedback from the community on how food insecurity affects their neighborhoods. This year, they’ll host a town hall where they’ll publish the data they’ve collected and strategize with neighborhood and city leaders the best route moving forward to ensuring everyone has access to fresh foods.

And speaking of routes, the COMET introduced the nation’s first-ever partnership between a local transit station and ride share apps like Uber and Lyft that will provide a $5 credit to riders who are riding to or from a fresh food market.

COMET to the Market will ensure that no one in our city is excluded from the option to go to a grocery store to purchase fresh food for their families.

We worked with our partners AARP to host the city’s first-ever Mayor’s Livability Summit, providing a space for residents to talk with city leaders and community partners about what matters most to the aging population. Our “perennials” as I’ve liked to call them represent the demographic in our country opening the most businesses and funneling the most money into our nation’s economy. Conversations on livability don’t just affect how well a city is prepared for an aging population; they discuss how a city can attract the experienced class as well.

It’s innovative ideas and opportunities like these that make our city stand out not only in our state but across our nation. Innovation that exists because of our investment in our community, not just as a coincidental consequence.

Intentionality is seen as we celebrate the grand opening of the Busby Street Resource & Training Complex - a facility that not only features a community engagement center but one that also serves as a public safety recruitment and hiring office and recreational complex for the neighborhoods in this area. With a focus on job training, youth services, educational programming and neighborhood activities, the complex will serve as a cornerstone for economic growth and community engagement.

Investments like these are made possible through partnerships with our good friends like Congressman Jim Clyburn and regional collaborations like the ones we have with Richland, Lexington, Kershaw and Fairfield counties - entities that know the value of pursuing partnerships for the betterment of the region and the state.

We will bring that same focus and excitement to revitalizing Finlay Park in an exciting public private partnership.

As we welcome new innovation economy jobs with corporations like Ritedose, Jushi and Capgemini to the region, we’ve seen what happens when municipalities and different levels of government work together. It doesn’t always happen in Washington, DC, but it does happen in South Carolina.

The Sumter-Columbia Empowerment Zone is South Carolina’s only empowerment zone and one of only a handful still in existence in our country. From the new senior housing complex - Veranda at North Main - to the Busby Street Center, the Columbia Empowerment Zone’s 10-year anniversary highlighted a decade of work that’s been integral in advancing our community.

And while 2018 was an excellent year, we still have much to look forward to in 2019.

As the next generation of business owners, lawyers, non-profit leaders, researchers, activists, social workers and everything in between prepares for adulthood, it is imperative that we as the current leaders pave a way for them to assume their roles in society seamlessly.

As we’ve seen with movements such as the March for our Lives and local efforts like Every Black Girl, our nation’s youth are no longer satisfied with learning about governmental processes - they want their voices heard and they want a seat at the table, regardless of their disqualification to vote under the age of 18.

It’s our responsibility to not only remind them that their opinions matter but to also include them in our priorities and planning.

The Columbia Youth Commission will convene nine high school-aged teens from Richland and Lexington counties. And to make things even more exciting, the program will return with a peer-based election for students to become part of this cohort of young minds.

That’s right - your 15-year-old neighbor might be an elected official.

We’re excited to engage with Richland One, Richland Two, Lexington-Richland 5 and private schools as our youth practice civic engagement at an early age.

We’ve been national leaders in the establishment and proper grounding of Opportunity Zones. We will release Columbia’s Opportunity Zone prospectus soon, and we anticipate these efforts will bring several millions of dollars of desired investment downtown and across North Columbia

Opportunity Zones aren’t just great incentives for outside investment; they’re economic engines for revitalizing and refreshing areas of our city that may have forgotten just how special they are.

And after introducing and passing with a nearly unanimous vote resolution in 2018 incentivizing more affordable housing in our city last year, it’s also an opportunity for us to see more of exactly what we need in our city and across the country; housing for everyone that everyone can afford.

We look forward to working with Richland County Council as they reconvene next month on moving these affordable housing incentives forward. As a city, we’ve historically been creative with incentivizing investment, and this year will be no different. Working with partners like Habitat for Humanity, we want to be seen as leaders, not just in our state but across the nation.

The tragic deaths of Mr. Calvin Witherspoon, Jr. & Mr. Derrick Caldwell Roper only underscore the urgency and creativity with which we should be working together to pursue more public sector & private sector affordable housing in our city.

In planning to be the city we aspire to become, the plan itself is of utmost importance. That’s why if you haven’t participated in Columbia Compass, the city’s process for updating its comprehensive plan, as well as the Amplify cultural planning process, we need you to get engaged. Columbia will celebrate its 250th year, or semiquincentennial, in 2036, so in preparation for a major birthday, our city planners are gathering input from the community to ensure every voice is heard and considered as plans for natural resources, land use, transportation, housing, community facilities, cultural resources, and economic development are made.

We can’t plan properly without knowing what matters most to you as our residents.

And while we can take guesses on these, there are a few areas we know are of particular importance regardless of who you are or which side of the proverbial aisle you prefer to sit.

The housing crisis affects us all in different ways. Without adequate housing for every range of the area median income, cities are stressed in providing resources for people who are forced to pay more for housing and less on the other important costs of life. And that’s a problem, particularly for the individuals and families that make up our community.

My law students in the room are not the only ones who recognize the importance of fairness in society - whether in law or in life itself. As we consider what is fair in 2019, we see such a discrepancy in opinions as we determine what is and is not fair.

But regardless of what you believe or where you come from, many of us can agree that getting a second chance is something of significant value.

But what if you never really got a first chance to begin with?

That’s why I will support a Ban the Box ordinance that will require city contractors to remove the question regarding past criminal offenses from job applications city-wide. The City of Columbia already implements Ban the Box tactics in its hiring, but we also want people who work for small businesses, for large corporations, for non-profit organizations and everything in between to have those same opportunities.

Data tells us that about the same number of Americans have criminal records as those who have college degrees, at about 70 million each. It’s an imperative for us to ensure that those who have paid their debts to society are given an opportunity to make a life for themselves and their families upon returning.

We’ve recently partnered with Goodwill Industries to assist in the job placement and hiring of more returning citizens, and we’re looking forward to not only City government but other companies and entities following suit. It is our prayer that government partners and corporate citizens following suit.

We will also be announcing a partnership with the SC Department of Corrections helping reconnect returning citizens with jobs and services as 60,000 jobs go unfilled across SC

[pause]

We will launch an innovative effort this year called Compassionate Columbia where we will enhance

Gateways & Community beautification.

Jobs for homeless citizens paired with volunteers will beautify gateways into our city and abate litter from our street - our environment - a massive community cleanup & beautification effort.



A compassionate City realizes that the past is well-organized, but the future doesn’t have a constituency—-that we must fight for the future.

We are struggling as a nation to handle many issues that we thought we put to bed decades ago.



Flags & swastikas that brave young men stormed the battlefield at Gettysburg and beaches of Normandy to defeat are being flown again.

Actual debates about the morality of human chattel slavery and the tragedy of the Holocaust are being waged by Americans.

Divisive ethnic, racial & religious rhetoric every day on social media.



Babies separated from their mothers breasts. Hate speech normalized.

Not only hate speech but deadly violence often cosigned from the highest levels of the republic.

This endless barrage of bitterness we watch on the news every night, the hate and vitriol flowing from what should be the world’s first and greatest temple of democracy…that is not the America we know and love.

I refuse to believe that this is a dark reflection of who we are.

This is a time when America needs leaders (POINT) needs love, and I would submit to you that we have it in abundance.

We will establish a 25 member Commission on Compassion & Inclusion that will be appointed by City Council and host its first meeting in March.

One of the first acts will be working with leaders in the Jewish Community in establishing a community leaders Sedar---the energy, passion and compassion that we saw at Beth Shalom Synagogue after the Pittsburgh Tree of Life anti-semitic massacre must inspire change in Columbia and the dialogue of America.

We must celebrate diversity, promote inclusivity and challenge bias we must denounce all acts of hate wherever they occur we must ensure public safety while protecting free speech and other constitutional rights we must encourage residents to report incidents and crimes we must bring people together to build trust

I remind you to feel compassion for those whose stories tug at your heart. Feel empathy for those who are going through difficult times and need all of the love and support they can get. Feel righteous anger for those who have been mistreated or disenfranchised.

And to even feel sympathy for those who - regardless of how grossly obvious an issue is – never feel anything for others.

You see, it’s not more information, more innovation or more ideology that’s going to change our city, our state and our nation. It’s compassion.

Compassion will be the fuel to the fire that burns with fervor to save this great democracy. A fire that allows those who have rarely or never taken into consideration how a law may impact someone’s life in a tremendous way will do so, and will do so thoughtfully.

Compassionate cities will provide a platform for human potential to flourish.

Wear compassion. Speak compassion. Infuse it into every conversation, every exchange you have with another individual. Allow compassion to not be a simple gesture each day but to be a lifestyle for you and particularly for your children.

This focus will allow us to become the city we aspire to be - to become the most talented, educated and entrepreneurial city in America.

We have seen the power of compassion in action.



From men and women who have inspired those who sit in these classrooms each day in Ernest Finney, J. Waites Waring, Matthew Perry & Jean Toal.



The compassion in action that removed the flag from our state capitol, and now as a direct result, our city will host both a NAACP conference & NCAA March Madness tournament.



The compassion in action that fed federal workers during the shutdown.



The compassion in action that we saw during the flood of 2015.



The compassion in action that we see in serving the displaced residents of Allen Benedict Court--thank you, Reverend McDowell.

The compassion in action at that gathering at the synagogue.

The compassion in action that passed the first bump stock ban that is now the law of the land.

This great city of Columbia was born March 17, 1786 by an act of the General Assembly of SC to be the first planned capital city in America, where the mighty Broad & Saluda Rivers met to form the Congaree— Birthed indeed in the original sins of American slavery, Native American genocide on the John Taylor Plantation.

State senator John Gervais’ quote made his most prescient Proclamation on “Inclusion”

Several considerations were made in deciding on the name Columbia. During the planning of the new capital, Senator Gervais said it would be a place, “where the oppressed of every land might find refuge, under the wings of Columbia.""

""And from the fertile silt and sediment washed upon these banks our fair city was born -- named for Liberty's personification so that victims of tyranny and oppression the world over might know: Here you will be welcome.

Here you will be free.



Here you will find refuge under the wings of Columbia.""

Compassion and inclusion are in our DNA.

Compassion extends itself to others without the necessitation of reciprocation.

Let it be our response, our choice.

Let it be what makes us an undefeatable, indivisible body. One Columbia.

It is THIS city that I want children to be able to be children in.

I want them to be able to fall from fences, have failed science experiments, I want them to feel the warm hug and the quiet whisper of a caring & compassionate adult saying, “I love you.”

I want them to know that when they have their experience at the roller rink, that their encounter with the Pope is just around the corner.

Together, I want us to build a compassionate city where “bad Stevie” will be allowed to be a child again.

God bless you, God bless Columbia and God bless the United States of America.",2019,01,29,https://www.wltx.com/article/news/mayor-benjamin-to-deliver-2019-state-of-the-city-address/101-ca502ced-77f6-4bb3-9024-9219e0f85749
bisnow,Industry Experts Cautiously Optimistic About The Future Of Opportunity Zones,"Want to get a jump-start on upcoming deals? Meet the major Chicago players at one of our upcoming events!

When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, it left many members of the commercial real estate community with uncertainty. Several clauses in the TCJA lack specification and clarity, leaving many looking for answers. Analysts have criticized the law for a series of glitches and typos that impose tax increases and stricter regulations on a number of business owners, while providing loopholes that benefit hedge funds and private equity firms. More than six months after the passing of the TCJA, the exact implications for the commercial real estate industry are still unclear.

One clause that will impact the way investors and developers do business is the creation of opportunity zones, found in section 13823 on page 130 of the tax overhaul. The provision incentivizes developers to build in low-income communities, or designated opportunity zones, across the U.S. to spur economic development and job growth. These zones are Congress’ attempt to stimulate the American economy through development in communities recovering from the recession. The concept has made many optimistic about the future of America’s most vulnerable communities, but tax advisers are worried the lack of clarity and the high level of risk could delay progress.

“I think everyone is pretty uncertain about what’s actually going to happen with opportunity zones,” RSM U.S. Director Paul Nadin said. “We’ve seen tax incentives like New Markets Tax Credits and Low Income Housing Tax Credits, but those are monetized. With opportunity zones, the incentive is a long-term investment, and these investors can only get returns after holding the investment for 10 years. The downside to this is I’m not sure how applicable that is going to be and if people are going to want to put money into a long-term investment, because it is risky and they could lose money.”

The opportunity zone concept was first introduced in 2015 by public policy firm Economic Innovation Group to help address the post-recession economic gap and the lack of growth in many American communities. It was reintroduced by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who grew up in a low-income community in North Charleston.

Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference

“I had to explain it several times to folks,” Scott said to the New York Times. “I came out of one of these communities, so I believe that there’s untapped potential in every state in the nation.”

The opportunity zones concept is the first community development tax program introduced and signed into law since the Clinton administration. The incentive resembles several past initiatives aimed at repairing the economy in America and abroad. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher tested a similar concept by creating 11 enterprise zones across the U.K., offering grants and tax breaks to communities in need. This concept reinvigorated several struggling areas, including spurring transformation of Canary Wharf from a series of neglected docks to a thriving financial district. Witnessing this success, President Ronald Reagan adopted the practice in the U.S. The Clinton administration expanded on the concept in 1993 and developed empowerment zones, which offered tax incentives and grants to assist economically distressed areas.

“The overall goal for all of these programs is to try to spur job growth in these low-income areas,” RSM partner Craig Mason said. “In the past, these zones were targeting a few specific areas, whereas today the target areas are based on each state identifying which areas they want to designate.”

The program uses low-income census tracts as a basis to determine which areas qualify as opportunity zones. These are areas with poverty rates of 20% or more and a median family income of 80% or less of the area median income. In every state, up to 25% of census tracts that qualify can be designated as opportunity zones. Since economic needs can vary by state and region, it is up to the governor of each state to determine which tracts qualify as opportunity zones. Once these tracts are approved, they remain opportunity zones for 10 years.

“Until some additional IRS guidance comes out, I don’t know how useful the program will be yet, and there has been a lot of uncertainty regarding if neighborhoods even qualify,” Nadin said. “People hope that guidance will come out later this year, but no one is really holding their breath. For developers, the question will be what their investment is going to be, what kind of business they are investing in and if it is worth it.”

Many developers will be going into these communities regardless of whether they qualify as an opportunity zone, Nadin said.

“You may have a community where, for instance, there is an attractive housing market and you are going in and building apartments anyway,” he said. “The opportunity zones might be an additional sweetener to incentivize some people to invest, but it wouldn’t necessarily be the sole reason they would go into one of these communities.”

While many developers look at opportunity zones as a way to contribute to these areas from a social impact standpoint, it also has to make sense economically, Mason said. They want to have a positive influence on these communities, but it is important to determine the impact from a tax perspective. It can be a risky investment, and if the investment declines, developers and investors may suffer an economic loss.

“I think we are all cautiously optimistic at this point in time,” Mason said. “We don’t know any more about opportunity zones today than we did six months ago. There are no additional regulations that have been published, and we need that guidance in order to properly advise our clients. This initiative could be a great opportunity for community development, but nobody will know for sure until we have more clarity.”

njspotlight,New Opportunity For New Jersey’s Distressed Towns and Cities,"Some 75 municipalities throughout New Jersey could benefit from new economic investment through a little-known provision of last year’s federal tax-reform law.

Gov. Phil Murphy has recommended that the U.S. Treasury Department designate portions of 75 towns, at least one in each county, Opportunity Zones. The goal of this federal program is to encourage capital investments in low-income or otherwise distressed communities. Its true impact likely will not be known for years.

“New Jersey is committed to using every tool at our disposal to develop our communities and grow our economy,” Murphy said in announcing his recommended zones in New Jersey last Thursday. “This program provides real opportunity for our state that has the potential to create significant, long-term economic development in the communities that need it the most.”

The Opportunity Zones program, written into the tax-reform law, had been sponsored as legislation by Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott (R-SC). The program is meant to provide opportunities for private investors to funnel money to distressed communities through newly created Opportunity Funds.

Working out the details

While treasury officials are still working out the details of program, the idea is this: A person would invest in a special fund that would then spend money to revitalize a community struggling with poverty and suffering from a lack of job or business growth.

The benefits for investors all involve a deferral or exclusion from taxable income of certain capital gains from investment in the funds, with the greatest benefits to those maintaining investments for at least a decade, which is the stated length of the program.

To qualify for consideration as an Opportunity Zones, a census tract — typically a section of a town or a small municipality — would have to have had a poverty rate of 20 percent or a median family income up to 80 percent of the area median. Murphy was allowed to designate as many as a quarter of the state’s eligible low-income census tracts, or up to 169 tracts, as Opportunity Zones, according to his office.

Officials from the state departments of community affairs and labor and workforce development and the state economic development and redevelopment authorities created a formula for determining which areas to recommend designating. According to Murphy’s office, that formula was based on such key economic indicators as income, unemployment, and property values and also accounted for geographic distribution, access to transit, and the value of existing investments. Murphy worked with Booker’s office, convened meetings and roundtables with mayors throughout the state, and met with members of Congress in selecting zones for recommendation. U.S. Treasury officials must provide feedback or approve Murphy’s suggested zones within the next month.

“Every community should have access to the resources needed to realize its full entrepreneurial potential,” Booker said. “But barriers stand between too many of our communities and the capital needed to generate economic growth and opportunity. I’m proud our governor is utilizing this tool to help drive investment across our state.”

Unclear impact

The impact the zones may have on communities is unclear. They could help revitalize communities largely passed over in the post-recession recovery. Similar programs, including empowerment zones and other designations made by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and the New Markets Tax Credit program authorized in 2000, resulted in at least some gains in employment and other economic benefits, but researchers reported they could not tie all the gains directly to those programs.

And they will only succeed if investors decide to put money into them.

The zones were the brainchild of the Economic Innovation Group, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, DC. Last year, that group published a Distressed Communities Index tool that measured how well places were faring based on factors surrounding poverty, education, housing, employment, and job and business creation.

That report concluded that one in six Americans, or a total of 52.3 million people, are living in economically distressed ZIP codes, where the median household income is significantly below the national average of $59,000 and job and business losses averaged 6 percent.

“Years into a steady economic expansion, it is all too easy to look at a low unemployment rate or record stock market gains and conclude that the tide is rising everywhere,” the report states. “As we will see, hidden beneath the national numbers is a deeply fragmented landscape of economic wellbeing — one in which far too many communities are being left behind.”

Most-distressed cities

The report found that 12.7 percent of people in New Jersey live in distressed ZIP codes, and it named three of the state’s cities among the most distressed in the nation. Newark ranked second most-distressed of the 100 largest American cities, while Trenton ranked second and Camden third most-distressed of the nation’s small and midsized cities.

All three of those cities include census tracts that Murphy has recommended be designated Opportunity Zones. These are the other communities with areas on the governor’s list:",0,0,0,http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/18/03/25/new-opportunity-for-new-jersey-s-distressed-towns-and-cities/
chicagotribune,"Gov. Rauner wants Illinois to have right-to-work zones, which unions decry","As Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner sets his sights on limiting the influence of unions in Illinois, he's pushing an idea he's dubbed ""empowerment zones"" — areas across the state where voters could decide if workers in their communities should be forced to join a union or pay associated dues.

It's a variation of what is more commonly called ""right to work"" — rules put in place at a statewide level to prevent unions from requiring workers who decline membership to pay related fees to cover the cost of collective bargaining they still benefit from. The concept, which generally applies to private-sector unions, has gained traction among conservative politicians across the nation as states try to spur economic growth following a brutal recession that saw businesses close and tax dollars dry up.

The like-minded new governor is unlikely to get a statewide ban on forced union membership from a General Assembly firmly controlled by Democrats, who historically have relied on employee unions for support come campaign season. Empowerment zones represent a trial program on the local level.

""I'm not trying to force the whole state to go right to work, I'm not advocating that,"" Rauner said Friday at a stop in Decatur. ""I want local voters, I want you to be empowered to decide this issue for yourselves, in your cities and in your county. I want that everywhere in the state. And the counties that liked the status quo and liked closed shop, keep it. Terrific. Those who want to compete and recruit more manufacturing firms and transportation companies, terrific.""

Rauner views right-to-work laws as a way to make Illinois more attractive to businesses that weigh operating costs here with other states. If companies come, Rauner argues, so do jobs and the associated tax dollars to help support government. To opponents, the policy is purely an attempt to weaken unions and drive down wages. They contend such measures cause more harm than good, as workers make less money and are forced to then rely on government assistance programs.

Taken with other ideas Rauner unveiled during his State of the State speech Wednesday, empowerment zones are being seen by some as just one piece of an all-out assault on unions and Illinois Democrats. Rauner also called for a ban on political donations by unions, giving taxpayers a say in the collective bargaining process at the local level, and ending the requirement that prevailing union wages be paid to workers on state and municipal construction projects.

""I'd think if I was a public-sector worker that Governor Rauner has declared war on us,"" said Tom Balanoff, president of the Service Employees International Union Illinois State Council, which represents workers who provide home health care, janitorial and maintenance services.

Rauner rejects that notion, saying he's not ""anti-union"" but merely endorsing the ""freedom to choose,"" and that being allowed to leave a union but still having to pay dues isn't much of a choice.

""You want to join a union? Terrific. God bless you,"" Rauner said Thursday in Troy, near St. Louis. ""Here's the issue. Today in Illinois, we are closed. If there's a union, you have join it, in government or in business. You know what? Other states don't enforce that. And companies that want to have the flexibility to have union or not to have their employees be able to sign, they don't come to places that enforce it.""

Rules regarding union enrollment are more nuanced than the governor lets on. Federal labor law, which applies to private-sector unions, does not require membership in a union as a condition of employment. However, because unions are legally bound to negotiate on behalf of all employees covered in the bargaining unit they represent, workers who choose not to join are still required to pay dues, or what is known as an ""agency fee."" The idea is that everyone who benefits from the collective bargaining, such as through higher wages and better retirement benefits negotiated by the union, should pay their fair share of associated costs.

There are similar rules for public employee unions in Illinois. Workers can choose to join a union, but those who do not are responsible for paying a ""fair share"" fee. Illinois law prohibits those fees from being used to support political candidates.

The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics Statics says there 831,000 union members in Illinois as of last year, representing about 15 percent of the state's workforce. An additional 49,000 workers were identified as having no union affiliation, but their jobs were covered by a union. It's that population of workers who likely pay agency fees to offset collective bargaining costs but choose to reject union membership.

Rauner said, ""the fair share is huge, it's almost 100 percent or 80 percent. That's not right.""

Those fees are at the center of the national right-to-work debate. In states that have put in place right-to-work laws, workers are no longer required to pay fees or dues to support collective bargaining efforts.

That sets up a system critics call a ""free ride,"" in which workers who don't pay into the system benefit at the expense of those who do. If enough workers take the free ride, unions don't have the financial resources to negotiate as fiercely, and their powers are weakened. Unions argue that leads to fewer rights for workers at the benefit of employers.

""You create a race to the bottom in terms of wages,"" said Bill Looby, political director of the Illinois AFL-CIO. ""It's an ideology that the economy will do better if the top does better. But that's a tired theory that hasn't worked. If we are going to stimulate our prosperity it needs to come from the middle class.""

The impact on worker incomes and economic growth depends on the ideology of the think tank doing the study.

tribune242,Empowerment zone could also help Family Islands,"By KHRISNA RUSSELL

Deputy Chief Reporter

krussell@tribunemedia.net

THE government wants the Economic Empowerment Zone Act's provisions to surpass the confines of New Providence and aid the advancement of Family Island economies where there is an urgent need for support.

However, it is unclear how the new law, which was passed in the Senate yesterday, will work along with the Family Islands Development Encouragement Act.

According to Attorney General Carl Bethel in the Senate yesterday, ahead of the legislation's debate in both lower and upper chambers of Parliament, Prime Minister Dr Hubert Minnis began work on the Crown land registry.

A proper registry will greatly support the success of this law, Mr Bethel said, adding it was an expression of confidence in Bahamians.

""This is a bill that applies throughout The Bahamas and the prime minister has already, you notice he's been making a lot of Family Island trips,"" he said yesterday during debate on the legislation in the Senate. ""He'll say he going down there to talk about VAT or he's going to talk about this that and the other, he's also going to do something very important.

""He takes with him usually Crown land officers to identify tracts of Crown land that are available and suitable for residential development. So, he has got an inventory of available tracts and allotments of Crown land from one end of this country to the next.

""It would be Crown lands that generally abuts or affronts on the Queen's Highway or the main road. Crown lands that are next to existing traditional settlement areas where you can have natural growth and expansion of home owning of Bahamians at minimal infrastructural costs. He has an inventory of that and he's adding to it every single time he visits a Family Island.""

Mr Bethel continued: ""Because the intention is that going forward over the coming year and years remaining in this term in office - this, the prime minister's first term in office, that we confidently hope and expect will be extended by the grace of God and the Bahamians people in due course - that over this term what will happen is that certain tracts will be surveyed off and allotments crafted and marked out and surveyed.

""The government will then come in and put in the essential infrastructure, a roadway making sure that water lines and electricity poles are in place and similarly these areas will be declared to be economic empowerment zones, which will then allow persons to utilise the law that we've crafted to build in government approved subdivisions their own dwelling homes and so we will see the orderly expansion of housing opportunities to thousands of Family Island residents throughout the length and breadth of this country so that the same opportunities will be afforded for the purchase of what we call serviced lots at below cost. ""The only cost being the cost of infrastructural improvement will be extended to them and they will have customs duty exemptions on all of the building supplies.

""But once an economic zone is declared, it will also facilitate businesses by Family Island residents to be established and to have all of the exemptions that are set out in this bill.""

Mr Bethel said Crown land also will be approved to established businesses. He said he told senators this was the first government in history to make law provisions to benefit the average Bahamian.

""So the perennial complaint of Bahamians is that their generation land or land that they consider commonage or Crown land are unavailable to them will be addressed in a systematic way, in a lawful way by a caring government that is going to make available to Bahamians the same economic exemptions that same tax incentives the foreigners get when they say they want to open a business or open up a hotel or do any kind of economic activity,"" Mr Bethel said.",2018,08,10,http://www.tribune242.com/news/2018/aug/10/empowerment-zone-could-also-help-family-islands/

lexology,Opportunity Zone Funds Offer New Tax Incentive for Long-Term Investment in Low-Income Communities,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in late December 2017 created a new capital gains exemption for taxpayers who make long-term investments in low-income communities that have been designated by the Treasury Department as “opportunity zones.” Following the completion of the six-month designation process, such zones now exist in every state, and roughly 12 percent of the nation’s land mass, including all of Puerto Rico, lies in an opportunity zone. Every major city has at least one opportunity zone, and the zones also exist in suburban and rural areas. Some opportunity zones in the West and Southwest appear to be larger than some of the smaller states in the Northeast.

The centerpiece of the opportunity zone legislation is a new type of investment vehicle called an opportunity zone fund (an “OZ fund”). The legislation encourages investment in opportunity zones by permitting a taxpayer to sell existing appreciated assets and “roll” the amount of realized gain (the “qualified gain amount”) into an OZ fund within 180 days of realization. Thus, the opportunity zone legislation does not seek merely to increase investments in low-income communities; its goal is to reallocate capital to these investments from appreciated investments outside the zone.

The opportunity zone legislation provides a powerful tax incentive to encourage such capital reallocation: If an investor rolls the qualified gain amount into an OZ fund and holds the OZ fund interest for at least 10 years, the taxpayer will not recognize any gain on the post-acquisition economic appreciation in its OZ fund interest (the “OZ tax exemption”).

The capital reallocation feature gives rise to the key limiting feature of the legislation: A taxpayer is entitled to the OZ tax exemption only with respect to an OZ fund interest (an “eligible OZ fund interest”) acquired by the taxpayer for an amount no greater than the qualified gain amount. The portion of an OZ fund interest attributable to any capital invested in excess of the qualified gain amount is not eligible for the OZ tax exemption. Thus, although a taxpayer is free to invest cash into an OZ fund in unlimited amounts, the benefit of the OZ tax exemption is limited to the portion of the OZ fund interest acquired with respect to a qualified gain amount realized on the sale of an existing appreciated asset. In addition, it is extremely difficult for a taxpayer to contribute appreciated assets to an OZ fund; indeed, such a contribution could prevent the OZ fund from qualifying as an OZ fund.

The requirement that a taxpayer sell an existing appreciated asset in order to benefit from the opportunity zone legislation amounts to a toll charge on the acquisition of an eligible OZ fund interest. To mitigate the toll charge, the recognition of gain realized on the sale of the appreciated asset is deferred until the end of 2026, and the amount of gain ultimately subject to tax is reduced by 10 percent for a taxpayer who holds its OZ fund interest for at least five years, and by an additional 5 percent (for a total of 15 percent) for a taxpayer who holds its OZ fund interest for at least seven years. Thus, a taxpayer desiring to take maximum advantage of the toll-charge reduction needs to make its OZ fund investments by the end of 2019, and there will be no reduction in the toll charge for a sale of an existing asset after 2021. Appendix A contains examples illustrating the operation of the OZ tax exemption and the deferral feature.

Although it can accommodate a wide variety of businesses, an OZ fund is particularly well-suited for certain types of real estate development projects, certain infrastructure and energy projects, and certain types of technology and service businesses. As follow-up to this mailer, which provides a broad overview of the opportunity zone legislation, we expect to address narrower, industry-specific considerations in one or more future mailers.

Summary of the Statute

The opportunity zone legislation is the latest in a series of tax-incentive programs designed to encourage investment, jobs and economic growth in low-income or economically distressed communities. In terms of operational provisions and statutory language, the opportunity zone legislation draws substantially from the new markets tax credit (NMTC) and empowerment zone provisions. Appendix B describes the similarities and differences among the three regimes.

As illustrated in Figure 1 below, at a high level, the OZ fund concept is simple: A taxpayer sells appreciated assets and, within 180 days, contributes cash in an amount not greater than the qualified gain amount to an OZ fund in exchange for an eligible OZ fund interest; the OZ fund uses that cash to invest in one or more opportunity zone businesses, either directly or through a subsidiary partnership or corporation; and the taxpayer reports the deferred gain in 2026 (such gain reduced, as appropriate) and, after 10 years, can sell its eligible OZ fund interest free of U.S. federal income tax, regardless of how much the eligible OZ fund interest has increased in value.

Figure 1

Despite this conceptual simplicity, the details of structuring an OZ fund can be complicated by certain statutory requirements. Compliance with the technical provisions of the statute are important, as a failure to comply could disqualify the OZ fund, potentially resulting in a significant penalty tax (discussed in more detail below) or even eliminating the deferral of gain and the OZ tax exemption.

In order to qualify as an OZ fund, an entity must establish that at least 90 percent of its assets, calculated as the average of two semiannual testing dates, are qualified opportunity zone property (QOZP). QOZP consists of (i) qualified opportunity zone business property (QOZBP), (ii) qualified opportunity zone corporate stock, or (iii) qualified opportunity zone partnership interests. For simplicity, we refer to issuers of qualified opportunity zone corporate stock and qualified opportunity zone partnership interests as “OZ portfolio companies.”

The key definitions of the opportunity zone legislation are:

Qualified Opportunity Zone Business Property. The term “QOZBP” is central to the definitions of OZ fund and OZ portfolio company. QOZBP means tangible property used in a trade or business if (i) such property is acquired by purchase after 2017; (ii) the original use of the property in the zone commences with the tested entity (e.g., an OZ fund or an OZ portfolio company) or the tested entity substantially improves the property; and (iii) during substantially all of the tested entity’s holding period for the property, substantially all of the use of the property is in the zone. An entity is treated as substantially improving property if, during any 30-month period, the entity makes capital expenditures with respect to such property at least equal to the property’s acquisition cost.

The term “QOZBP” is central to the definitions of OZ fund and OZ portfolio company. QOZBP means tangible property used in a trade or business if (i) such property is acquired by purchase after 2017; (ii) the original use of the property in the zone commences with the tested entity (e.g., an OZ fund or an OZ portfolio company) or the tested entity substantially improves the property; and (iii) during substantially all of the tested entity’s holding period for the property, substantially all of the use of the property is in the zone. An entity is treated as substantially improving property if, during any 30-month period, the entity makes capital expenditures with respect to such property at least equal to the property’s acquisition cost. OZ Portfolio Company Requirements. In order for equity of an OZ portfolio company to qualify as QOZP in the hands of an OZ fund, (i) the OZ fund must acquire its equity interest in the OZ portfolio company for cash at original issuance after 2017; (ii) the OZ portfolio company must be a qualified opportunity zone business (or, if newly formed, organized for the purpose of becoming a qualified opportunity zone business); and (iii) during substantially all of the OZ fund’s holding period, the OZ portfolio company must be a qualified opportunity zone business.

In order for equity of an OZ portfolio company to qualify as QOZP in the hands of an OZ fund, (i) the OZ fund must acquire its equity interest in the OZ portfolio company for cash at original issuance after 2017; (ii) the OZ portfolio company must be a qualified opportunity zone business (or, if newly formed, organized for the purpose of becoming a qualified opportunity zone business); and (iii) during substantially all of the OZ fund’s holding period, the OZ portfolio company must be a qualified opportunity zone business. Qualified Opportunity Zone Business. A qualified opportunity zone business (sometimes referred to herein as an “OZ business”) is a trade or business (i) in which substantially all of the tangible property (if any) owned or leased by the business is QOZBP; (ii) at least 50 percent of the gross income (presumably of the OZ portfolio company being tested) is derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in the opportunity zone; (iii) a substantial portion of the intangible property of the entity is used in the active conduct of such business; (iv) less than 5 percent of the basis of the property of such business is attributable to “nonqualified financial property”; and (v) the entity does not engage in, or lease land to, a so-called “sin business” (which includes a golf course, country club, massage parlor, hot tub facility, suntan facility, racetrack, gambling facility and liquor store). The term “nonqualified financial property” means debt, stock, partnership interests and certain types of derivatives but does not include cash and short-term debt instruments held as reasonable working capital.

Issues and Considerations

The foregoing definitions and the other provisions of the opportunity zone legislation create a number of issues and considerations for a taxpayer wishing to avail itself of the OZ tax exemption. These issues and considerations will affect decisions regarding structural and operational matters that affect every stage of an OZ fund investment — from the sale transaction by which the qualified gain amount is recognized, to the formation and financing of the OZ fund itself and any OZ portfolio company, to the acquisition and operation of the OZ fund’s or an OZ portfolio company’s assets, to a taxpayer’s exit from its OZ fund investment. The following is a non-exhaustive list of important issues and considerations.

Who Is the Taxpayer? As currently written, the statute requires that the exact same taxpayer that sold the existing asset at a gain be the investor in the OZ fund. In addition, once an OZ fund interest is acquired, the deferred gain on the existing asset is accelerated if the OZ fund interest is transferred — even upon a transfer to an affiliate in a nonrecognition transaction. Accordingly, if a partnership is the seller of the existing asset, the ownership of the asset or the holdings of the partners may need to be restructured if the partners differ on whether to invest the sales proceeds in an OZ fund. Similarly, if a trust owns the asset that is to be sold, careful consideration must be given to the tax classification of the trust and whether that status is expected to change, as a change could affect the timing of recognition on the deferred gain and, possibly, the availability of the OZ tax exemption itself.

Capital Infusions. Taxpayers will also need to manage the infusion of capital into an OZ fund and any OZ portfolio company owned by the OZ fund. Unlike a typical investment fund, no more than 10 percent of an OZ fund’s assets can consist of cash and intangible assets as of its six-month and year-end testing dates. In addition, if an OZ portfolio company maintains cash beyond its then-current reasonable working capital needs, such excess cash may not represent more than 5 percent of the assets of such OZ portfolio company. If an OZ portfolio company fails this test, an OZ fund that owns equity in the OZ portfolio company may lose its status as an OZ fund. These issues can be managed through a variety of techniques, including staging capital calls into OZ funds and using revolving credit facilities and other forms of leverage at the OZ portfolio company to ensure that cash in excess of reasonable working capital is available to be deployed in a way that complies with the asset tests.

Capital Structure. The use of a capital structure that provides for non-pro rata distributions — such as a structure that has both common and preferred interests or certain structures that involve “carried interests” — may not be appropriate for an OZ fund. The opportunity zone legislation provides Treasury with broad power to issue rules to “prevent abuse,” and it is important to bear in mind that the NMTC regime, from which large portions of the opportunity zone legislation was drawn, views certain types of non-pro rata distributions as abusive. If non-pro rata economics are desired, it may be prudent to use a structure in which multiple OZ funds (each one providing for pro rata sharing) own different classes of interests in the applicable OZ portfolio company.

Use of OZ Portfolio Companies. The most basic structural decision that any OZ fund must make is whether to invest in an OZ business directly or whether to hold its OZ business through an OZ portfolio company. Because of the different rules that apply under these circumstances (the key examples of which are illustrated in Appendix C), this decision is surprisingly consequential. Below are some of the key differences and uncertainties that will inform that decision.

Intangibles and Working Capital. Among the most surprising differences between the rules governing OZ funds and OZ portfolio companies are that the OZ fund asset test that applies to a directly conducted business requires the business to own tangible property and significantly limits the ability of the business to own intangible property or reasonable working capital; by contrast, the test applicable to an OZ portfolio company does not require the business to own tangible property and does not limit the amount of intangible assets or reasonable working capital that the business can own,1 as long as a substantial portion of its intangible assets are used in the active conduct of a trade or business within the opportunity zone.2 Thus, the statute would appear to prohibit an OZ fund from directly conducting a business that relies heavily on intangible assets and reasonable working capital. For this reason alone, we anticipate that, pending further guidance, most OZ businesses will be conducted through portfolio companies. Except as otherwise indicated, the balance of this piece assumes that an OZ business will be operated through one or more OZ portfolio companies.

Startup OZ Portfolio Companies. One of the primary goals of the opportunity zone legislation is the creation of new opportunity zone businesses. One prong of the OZ fund asset test allows an OZ fund to hold equity of a new OZ portfolio company formed for the purpose of becoming a qualified OZ business in the future. The next prong provides that, in order for equity in an OZ portfolio company to constitute QOZP, the OZ portfolio company must be engaged in a qualified OZ business during substantially all of the OZ fund’s holding period in the portfolio company’s equity. Given that a business may require a year or more to become operational (and thereby satisfy the trade or business test), and that the OZ fund asset test is effectively tested every six months, some commentators have expressed concern that the statutory language could conceivably be interpreted as precluding startups that take more than a few months to become operational. By analogy, the NMTC regulations treat a startup business as an active trade or business if the business is reasonably expected to produce revenue within the first three years. If this rule were applied to, or incorporated into, the OZ fund regime, it would facilitate the creation of startup businesses in an opportunity zone.

OZ Portfolio Company Income Test. An OZ portfolio company must satisfy the 50 percent gross income test described above. If an OZ business fails this test (for example, during the start-up period), the status of the OZ fund, and thus the effectiveness of the initial deferral of gain recognition and the availability of the OZ tax exemption, could be jeopardized. Again, the NMTC regime may provide some guidance. An NMTC business must pass a gross income test that is similar to the gross income test applicable to OZ businesses. Under a safe-harbor rule, an NMTC business is deemed to have gross income commensurate with the amount of assets it possesses, and the amount of services it provides, inside a low-income community. Until more specific guidance tailored to the opportunity zone legislation is developed, a similar safe-harbor rule could provide clarity to taxpayers with respect to OZ fund investments.

Acquired by Purchase. In the real estate sector, one complication is the manner in which an OZ fund or OZ portfolio company obtains real estate. In order for a property to constitute QOZBP in the hands of an OZ fund or an OZ portfolio company, it must have been acquired from an unrelated party by purchase. It is common for real estate joint ventures to be formed between a property owner who contributes property in exchange for an equity interest and a developer who contributes development capital and/or services. The requirement that the property be acquired by purchase from an unrelated third party will preclude an OZ fund or an OZ portfolio company from utilizing that structure. The parties would need to consider other options, perhaps using separate land and development joint ventures, with ground leases and other forms of financing between the ventures. Even in situations where the current property owner is willing to sell property for cash and reinvest the cash proceeds in the OZ portfolio company, these types of parallel structures may need to be utilized if the existing owner would own a large enough interest in the OZ portfolio company to be treated as a “related party.”

Original Use of the Property. Another requirement for property to qualify as QOZBP is that either (i) the original use of the property must commence with the OZ fund or OZ portfolio company or (ii) the OZ fund or OZ portfolio company must make capital expenditures with respect to the property in an amount at least equal to the property’s acquisition cost. This requirement may prove challenging for an OZ fund or OZ portfolio company looking to invest in real estate. It may be impossible for the OZ fund or OZ portfolio company to prove that it is the first one to use a property during the property’s existence, leading to the conclusion that Congress did not intend that the word “original” be interpreted literally. In connection with empowerment zone provisions that contain similarly worded “original use” requirements, the Treasury Department has enacted a fair and common sense rule under which a taxpayer can satisfy the original use test with respect to any real property that has been vacant for at least a year. Until a similar rule is incorporated into the opportunity zone context, real estate developers who cannot satisfy the “substantial improvement” standard will need to either incur a degree of risk concerning the definition of “original use” or consider alternate development structures, such as those outlined above.

Activities Outside the Opportunity Zone. Any business that aspires either to grow outside an opportunity zone or locate facilities (e.g., offices, factories or warehouses) outside the zone will need to adopt an extremely flexible corporate structure and set of commercial arrangements. The statute requires that substantially all of the tangible property of an OZ portfolio company be located within the opportunity zone. The “normal” business reaction to this limitation — forming subsidiaries that operate outside the zone — is unavailable, because the statute prohibits an OZ portfolio company from owning equity in subsidiaries if such equity represents more than 5 percent of the value of the assets of the OZ portfolio company. Even if an OZ portfolio company manages to operate outside an opportunity zone without owning or leasing tangible property, more than 50 percent of the gross income of an OZ portfolio company must be attributable to business activity in the zone — a standard that, under the NMTC rules, can be satisfied through the use of tangible property or the provision of services inside the zone. Given these constraints — particularly those relating to the ownership of subsidiary equity — business expansion may have to be facilitated through more complicated arrangements, such as the use of sister companies that are owned outside an OZ fund structure or through independent service providers. This will necessarily complicate financing arrangements, licensing agreements and vendor contracts, among other things.

OZ Fund Partnerships and the Zero-Basis Rule. The opportunity zone legislation provides that a taxpayer’s basis in its eligible OZ fund interest is zero, except to the extent necessary to reflect: (i) the recognition of deferred gain; (ii) the reduction in deferred gain for OZ fund interests held for at least five years; and (iii) the OZ tax exemption. In the case of an OZ fund that is organized as a partnership, the statute, read literally, does not provide for any adjustments to the taxpayer's basis in its eligible OZ fund interest pursuant to the normal operation of Subchapter K, such as for income, losses or liabilities allocated by the OZ fund to its partners. This could result in permanent double taxation of partnership income and capital distributions (including distributions that would otherwise be eligible for tax deferred treatment due to the allocation of liabilities by the partnership to the partners). This rule also calls into question the availability of cost-recovery deductions for assets acquired by an OZ fund partnership and the extent to which any suspended losses will be available. Congress and Treasury are aware of these issues. Nevertheless, given the complexity of integrating the zero-basis rule into the existing partnership tax regime, it may be some time before these issues are addressed.

The Penalty Tax. If an OZ fund fails the asset test, the OZ fund statute imposes a monthly penalty equal to the product of the excess nonqualifying assets and the annual underpayment rate in effect for the month of the failure. Some commentators have suggested that the penalty is too large for the offense and that perhaps the penalty base should equal the amount of tax that would be due on the deferred gain, and that a monthly penalty should be based on the monthly (not annual) underpayment rate. In addition, it is not at all clear what, if anything, happens if the OZ fund fails the asset test in the same month in which a taxpayer either contributes cash to the OZ fund or sells its interest in the OZ fund. The statute could be interpreted to disqualify the fund as an OZ fund as of the sale date or contribution date, as the case may be, resulting in no deferral of gain and no OZ tax exemption. Until the consequences of such a failure are clarified, taxpayers would be well-advised to assume that an OZ fund asset test failure coinciding with either an OZ fund contribution or OZ fund sale could be catastrophic to their tax-planning objectives, and to structure accordingly.

Exiting an OZ Fund. Exiting an OZ fund investment requires particularly careful planning. The OZ tax exemption is only available if an investor sells its interest in the OZ fund. Thus, for an OZ fund that is organized as a partnership (which is likely to describe most OZ funds), the exemption does not apply when the OZ fund sells an OZ portfolio company or any other assets it owns, or when an OZ portfolio company sells its assets. Unless Congress amends the statute, this limitation is likely to discourage the creation of diversified OZ funds, which was arguably one of the goals for the opportunity zone legislation. In the meantime, it may be prudent for taxpayers to structure OZ funds with a view toward an exit through a sale of fund interests.

Finally, in situations where an investor makes multiple capital contributions to a partnership OZ fund over time, it is critical to bear in mind that the Internal Revenue Service views a partnership interest as a unified security with multiple or segmented holding periods based on when contributions are made. Consequently, for a partnership OZ fund to which the investor has made capital contributions over time, the sale of a portion of the OZ eligible fund interest before the 10th anniversary of the last OZ eligible contribution will not fully qualify for the OZ tax exemption. There may be more flexibility to make partial sales of equity interests in an OZ fund organized as a corporation if the taxpayer can specifically identify and sell only those shares that satisfy the requisite holding period.

Conclusion

If the level of investor interest and activity that we have witnessed over the past six months is any indication, the opportunity zone legislation has the potential to be a powerful driver of investment activity. The uncertainties associated with certain aspects of the legislation may, however, hamper that activity, and the manner in which these uncertainties are resolved by Congress and Treasury will likely determine the ultimate success of the program.

The following examples address only U.S. federal income tax consequences and do not include state, local or other tax consequences.

Example 1: OZ Fund Interest Sold Before Year 10

Facts In 2018, taxpayer sells an asset with a basis of $1,000 and a fair market value of $2,500 for $2,500 in cash, realizing a gain of $1,500 Taxpayer contributes $1,500 of cash to an OZ fund The OZ fund contributes that cash to an OZ partnership Taxpayer sells the OZ fund interest for $2,500 in 2027 (i.e., without satisfying the 10-year holding period)

Tax Consequences Taxpayer does not recognize $1,500 of gain in 2018 Taxpayer takes a $0 basis in its OZ fund interest Taxpayer’s basis in its OZ fund interest increases from $0 to $150 in 2023 Taxpayer’s basis in its OZ fund interest increases from $150 to $225 in 2025 Taxpayer recognizes $1,275 of gain in 2026 ($1,500 of deferred gain minus $225 of basis step-up) Taxpayer’s basis in its OZ fund interest increases to $1,500 as a result of 2026 gain recognition Taxpayer recognizes $1,000 of gain in 2027 ($2,500 minus $1,500 basis)



Example 2: OZ Fund Interest Sold After Year 10

Facts Same as Example 1, except that the taxpayer sells the OZ fund interest for $2,500 in 2028 (after holding the OZ fund interest for more than 10 years) instead of 2027

Tax Consequences Taxpayer does not recognize $1,500 of gain in 2018 Taxpayer takes a $0 basis in its OZ fund interest Taxpayer’s basis in its OZ fund interest increases from $0 to $150 in 2023 Taxpayer’s basis in its OZ fund interest increases from $150 to $225 in 2025 Taxpayer recognizes $1,275 of gain in 2026 ($1,500 of deferred gain minus $225 of basis step-up) Taxpayer’s basis in its OZ fund interest increases to $1,500 as a result of 2026 gain recognition Taxpayer recognizes $0 of gain on the $1,000 of economic appreciation in the OZ fund interest between 2018 and 2028

chalkbeat,Memphis and Nashville put on notice about which schools could face state takeover in 2020,"In one of her final acts as Tennessee education commissioner, Candice McQueen has identified nearly 20 schools that could require the most drastic state interventions — including possibly state takeover in 2020 — if their test scores don’t increase dramatically, according to documents obtained by Chalkbeat.

Eleven Memphis schools and eight in Nashville were singled out by McQueen in the second round of intervention plans for low-performing schools under the state’s new school improvement model. The recommendations — one of which reverses a decisions she made in February — were outlined in letters dated Nov. 29 and Dec. 14 to Director Shawn Joseph and Superintendent Dorsey Hopson, respectively.

While she didn’t recommend the state take over any schools next year, McQueen suggested closing one school, Hawkins Mill Elementary in Memphis, for the second year in a row. The local district rejected her recommendation to close it last year.

And in a reversal of a recommendation that she made earlier this year, McQueen is suggesting that American Way Middle remain under Shelby County Schools, for now. The district moved the school into its own school turnaround program known as the Innovation Zone, or iZone, this year after McQueen said the district should either hand it over to a charter operator or the state would.

A school is at risk of state takeover if it has had repeat appearances on the state’s “priority list” of lowest performing schools and has shown relatively low academic growth.

The recommendations have more Memphis schools at risk of state takeover than McQueen’s last plan released in February, when only one was slated for the state-run Achievement School District. That’s despite Shelby County Schools having fewer schools on the priority list than in previous years.

The state’s improvement plan to comply with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act was crafted to give local districts more say in how to improve its schools. Before, there was no tiered approach before resorting to state takeover.

But the state’s most drastic tool in school turnaround has not proven to be effective. In fact, recent research has shown schools in the district are no better off than schools that received no intervention. Still, McQueen says underperforming schools that have languished for years need a change — and she believes the state district’s new leader, Sharon Griffin, will make a difference. Griffin is the former chief of schools for Shelby County Schools and ran the iZone, the Memphis-led program that outperformed the state.

“The decisions on specifically which schools, when they will move into the district, and what that planning and transition timeline will look like will be based on the results and data we are seeing this school year (2018-19) and after we have additional discussions with districts, community members, operators, and other key stakeholders and state leaders,” said state department spokeswoman Sara Gast.

The state did not provide specific benchmarks the schools must meet to avoid takeover, but said the department would include consideration of academic growth, graduation rate, and what other schools feed into them.

McQueen identified the following Memphis schools that “will continue in the specific intervention that was designated for them last year.” If they don’t meet the state’s expectations for academic progress during the 2018-19 standardized test, they could be slated for state takeover.

American Way Middle (iZone)

Geeter K-8 (Whitehaven Empowerment Zone)

Hamilton High (iZone)

Magnolia Elementary (iZone, and will combine with Alcy Elementary in a new building in 2019)

Trezevant High (iZone)

These Memphis and Nashville schools will undergo a “rigorous planning process and implement district-led, evidence-based interventions.” They either appeared again on the state’s priority list after exiting in previous years, made their second appearance on the list this year, or would have made the list if 2017-18 test scores counted. If they don’t significantly improve on 2018-19 tests, they could be considered for closure, state takeover, or charter conversion under the local district.

Georgian Hills Middle

Manassas High

Northwest Prep Academy

Wooddale High

Nashville

Buena Vista Elementary

Cumberland Elementary

Gra-Mar Middle

Jere Baxter Middle

Joelton Middle

Robert Churchwell Elementary

Madison Middle

The Cohen Learning Center

These Memphis schools have shown high academic growth, but still appear on the state’s 2018 priority list. Next year, these schools could be eligible for the Achievement School District if they don’t continue to show high growth.

Sheffield Elementary

Westwood High

Memphis charter schools that appeared on the state’s priority list are also included in McQueen’s recommendations even though state law says the local school board must close them. State officials did not immediately explain why the charter schools were included. Shelby County Schools board delayed a vote in October to review data and get guidance from the state.

Clarification: Dec. 20, 2018: The headline and the story have been updated to clarify that the schools outlined in the story as facing a state takeover may instead receive some other state intervention.

nationalheraldindia,Women and backlash politics of the right wing,"The politics of the right wing in India has typically been a politics of backlash against values of the kind symbolised by a marginalised group. Currently, this is most visibly represented by assertive women politicians. To the female politician baiters, women, as mass leaders asserting their will over men, are a direct challenge to Indian politics’ essential masculinity: the 56-inch chest, the growling guerrilla style chest thumping declaration of paurush and purusharth, dubbing men unlike themselves as napunsak, a eunuch. But that has not stalled the inevitable rise at the national level, of major political leaders like Indira Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati and now Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

Priyanka has yet to prove her mettle, but it is generally agreed that she has the potential. Even her opponents concede this. Hence the recent spurt in some of them sneeringly referring to her Chikna Chehra, attractive face, as being the sole reason for her popularity. Another resorts to remarks about how when not addressing public rallies in Indian dresses, Priyanka dresses in jeans (read favoured attire of westernised, liberated women long declared subversive collectively by the Bajrang Dal, Sri Ram Sene and the khap panchayats of Haryana). The fact is that powerful NDA leaders have been shaken by not one but three major female leaders facing them in the crucial 2019 Elections. Their media cells and supporters are at pains to destroy that challenge. They are trying hard to establish that feminism as a political ideology has failed. That women in politics are not so much defending a failed ideology as resurrecting a culture of barren wombs and the breakdown of the family system as we know it. Mayawati, Mamata or the late Jayalalithaa, all have been subjected to sneering remarks about their single status. Ironically, this comes from a quarter where the top leader-in-chief is himself a single man. He proudly and publicly declares himself again and again as being a Fakir, a man without any worldly ties!

In this scenario, Priyanka poses a problem to female baiters. She has, before stepping into mainstream politics, fulfilled all traditional roles: a nurturing mother and caring and respectful daughter and a loyal wife to her husband. So unsurprisingly, they now train their guns against her as they have been doing against her mother, for being dynasts and destroyers of healthy democratic principles. The careers of these two women are illustrative of how the strictures women face in their rise to power are not only harsh but also frequently self-contradictory.

The family defines women in every sphere in India. Despite our liberal Constitution and the 1994 (73rd-74th) Amendment that gave women 33% reservation in local bodies, women continue to be defined by the families they belong to, less by their own merit. Compared to their male counterparts, they are far more likely to be quizzed by the media and their opponents about their family. And the political gatekeepers in most parties still being men, they are more comfortable networking with men and assume that female candidates are less likely to win unless backed by a powerful clan. Interestingly, available hard data about women candidates’ ultimate winnability reveals women, if they cross the odds and get tickets, win proportionally more with higher margins than men.",0,0,0,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/women-and-backlash-politics-of-the-right-wing
dallasnews,Opportunity Zones are just the same old tax incentives that hardly help the poor,"The program allows investors to roll capital gains into Opportunity Funds without triggering capital gains taxes. Capital gains taxes, at rates as high as 20 percent, are generally levied when an asset is sold. Additionally, returns from an Opportunity Fund are tax free, if the investment is held for at least 10 years. Finally, capital gains rolled into a fund receive a step-up in basis of as much as 15 percent. In other words, 15 percent of (otherwise taxable) capital gains rolled into a fund could be exempt from taxation.

Proponents claim that these tax preferences will spur economic activity and revitalize poor communities. Census tracts are eligible if their poverty rate is above 20 percent and if median income is below 80 percent of median income for the region.

Despite the connotative appeal of ""opportunity,"" the track record for place-based initiatives is mediocre at best. Such policies are termed ""place based"" because they focus on geographic locations, as opposed to targeting individuals or families. The wrongheadedness of such policies is addressed by Harvard economist Edward Glaeser in his book, The Triumph of the City. Glaeser states, ""Too many officials in troubled cities wrongly imagine that they can lead their city back to its former glories with some massive construction project.""

In the post-World War II era, place-based policies were grand in their ambitions, while having disastrous consequences for many poor people. By the 1980s, programs had become more modest in their goals and the power granted to displace people. Opportunity Zones are their latest incarnation, sharing much with state-based enterprise zones from the 1980s and Federal Empowerment Zones from the 1990s.

Economists David Neumark and Helen Simpson conclude in an extensive review that evidence from these programs was mixed. However, it is surprising how little employment appears to have been generated from the programs. In fact, despite extensive research, it remains an open question whether such programs increase employment at all.",2018,04,12,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/04/12/opportunity-zones-just-old-tax-incentives-hardly-help-poor
politico,Ryan says he’s leaving behind ‘a darn good legacy’,"""We have done what needs to be done to get a stronger, more durable foundation under the economy,"" Speaker Paul Ryan said. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Ryan says he’s leaving behind ‘a darn good legacy’

House Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing back against reports that his congressional legacy will be overshadowed by a perceived deference to President Donald Trump.

Since announcing last week that he's not seeking reelection and will retire from Congress in January, the Wisconsin Republican has come under criticism in both national and local media for not doing enough to stand up to the commander in chief or sticking to his long-held conservative views on fiscal spending.

Story Continued Below

In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Ryan ticked off some legislative accomplishments, including the recent $1.5 trillion tax cut and establishing ""empowerment zones.""

""We have done what needs to be done to get a stronger, more durable foundation under the economy,"" the speaker said, adding that he's ""excited"" about the GOP's agenda, which will ""focus on career and technical education.""

""We're going to focus on getting people from welfare into jobs. And we can do this when we had a strong growing economy. And that's a darn good legacy,"" Ryan said.

Still, the speaker, after saying he and Trump ""basically agreed on agenda,"" declined to say whether he and the president share the same vision for the Republican Party.

""I can't speak to that. You'd have to ask him that,"" Ryan said, adding the two ""obviously"" don't agree on trade.

But, Ryan predicted Trump would come around to his way of thinking on other issues, like entitlements.

""I think he's going to realize that that’s an important thing. ... Look, two out of the three health care entitlement programs, he was there with us on health care. The fact of the matter is it didn't pass the Senate,"" Ryan said.

""Nine out of 10 things we're rolling in the same direction,"" Ryan added. ""No two people are going to agree on everything. We have different styles. We have different ideas. But it's a big-tent party. And we represent different corners of the tent.""",2018,04,15,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/15/paul-ryan-house-speaker-legacy-523518
